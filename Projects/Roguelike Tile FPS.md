High Level Concept
A roguelike FPS where the level is built and expanded by the player as they progress. During the game, players are presented with a reward which can be placed into the level. Cards can be anything like additional rooms, enemy spawners, weapons, health and ammo pick ups, chests, etc. More difficult encounters result in better rewards.

Setting:
 Digital Realm Exploration
- **Premise**: The player is a hacker or digital explorer trapped inside a virtual world or computer system. This setting allows for a wide range of non-organic enemies, such as corrupted data entities, firewalls manifested as aggressive drones, or hostile AI guardians.
- **Mechanic Integration**: Rooms represent sectors of the digital realm that the player must unlock and navigate. Buffs might be represented as power-ups or system exploits that enhance the player's capabilities at a cost.
- **Enemy Types**: Hostile AI, digital constructs, virus-like drones, firewall barriers, and glitch entities.
