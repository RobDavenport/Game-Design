A survivor crash lands on an island and needs to survive. A game where you control an island and take care of a crashed survivor. Tile laying, board-game like, roguelike elements. On success, the crashed survivor makes it their new home, attracts more survivors, and lives happily ever after. On failure, the survivor swims away to questionable success (or another island).

Turn based, strategy. Survival
