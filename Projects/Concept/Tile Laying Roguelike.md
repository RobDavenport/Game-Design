Roguelike deckbuilding tile laying game, blending the simplistic board-game like gameplay of Party House (UFO 50) and the tile placing puzzle elements from Tiny Islands. Each level, players follow these steps:

1. Choose to draw a tile, or end the level.
2. Draw a random tile.
4. Place the tile on a grid tile.
5. Back to 1.

At the end of the level, tiles will be scored based off of their base values, as well as potential adjacency or placement bonuses depending on their location.

Win Objective:
Deciding between:
1. Complete a level with 4 "win" points on tiles within the time limit
2. Generate enough of a certain resource to pass the level.

Potential Stories (GPT)
To tie the random draw mechanic into your asteroid mining theme while adding a corporate backstory, you could create a narrative where the player is a contractor or franchise owner of a mining operation, relying on a **central corporate supplier** that handles logistics but makes questionable decisions about delivery and drone types. Here’s how it could look:
### Story Context

The player is an independent operator contracted by a massive, bureaucratic mining corporation (think _AstroMining Unlimited_ or _Frontier Industries_). They’re tasked with managing the extraction and resource management on remote asteroids. However, due to corporate cost-cutting, inefficiency, or even the unpredictable nature of deep-space supply chains, the player’s **supplies are randomized**. Each “day,” corporate sends a batch of drones (tiles) from their main distribution center, but the types and quality vary widely, sometimes even including dangerous or malfunctioning units.

Danger Bust Mechanics:
Consider:
1. Instead of full bust, gain partial resources (like 25, 50 or 75%)
2. Gain full resources, but pay flat or scaling penalty after collection
