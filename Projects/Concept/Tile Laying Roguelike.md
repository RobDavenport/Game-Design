Roguelike deckbuilding tile laying game, blending the simplistic board-game like gameplay of Party House (UFO 50) and the tile placing puzzle elements from Tiny Islands. Each level, players follow these steps:

1. Choose to draw a tile, or end the level.
2. Draw a random tile.
4. Place the tile on a grid tile.
5. Back to 1.

At the end of the level, tiles will be scored based off of their base values, as well as potential adjacency or placement bonuses depending on their location.

Win Objective:
Deciding between:
1. Complete a level with 4 "win" points on tiles within the time limit
2. Generate enough of a certain resource to pass the level.

Potential Stories (GPT)
To tie the random draw mechanic into your asteroid mining theme while adding a corporate backstory, you could create a narrative where the player is a contractor or franchise owner of a mining operation, relying on a **central corporate supplier** that handles logistics but makes questionable decisions about delivery and drone types. Here’s how it could look:
### Story Context

The player is an independent operator contracted by a massive, bureaucratic mining corporation (think _AstroMining Unlimited_ or _Frontier Industries_). They’re tasked with managing the extraction and resource management on remote asteroids. However, due to corporate cost-cutting, inefficiency, or even the unpredictable nature of deep-space supply chains, the player’s **supplies are randomized**. Each “day,” corporate sends a batch of drones (tiles) from their main distribution center, but the types and quality vary widely, sometimes even including dangerous or malfunctioning units.

Danger Bust Mechanics:
Consider:
1. Instead of full bust, gain partial resources (like 25, 50 or 75%)
2. Gain full resources, but pay flat or scaling penalty after collection

Potential gpt prompt:
primary gameplay mechanics:

- placing tiles

- buying tiles at the end of each round

- attempting to reach 4 "win points" to win a run

- drawing 3 or more danger will end the round prematurely

resource dynamics

- two main resources.

- 1 is for obtaining new tiles. primary resource, easily generated

- 1 is for using bot abilities as well as buying grid expansions. not as easily generated. more grid space allows more tiles to be placed on each round

theme preferences:

- something sci fi

- needs to work well with low poly 3d models, or pixel art

- super short development cycle (1month), so modularity and flexibility

- bonus points for something which lets players connect with certain tiles or strategies, for example, cool and interesting robots.

- no time or skill to do organic objects

level structure:

- player draws a random tile and places that tile somewhere on the grid

- then they can decide to end the level, to avoid busting, or continue drawing another tile.

- should the player draw 3 danger, they must end the level after placing it

- a window to activate any last tile abilities

- on level end, all resource earnings are calculated and pooled into the players inventory to be used in the shop

shop screen:

- contains 8 tiles, assortment of pre-selected and randomly selected tiles

- can purchase tiles to add to the deck for the next round

- can spend 2nd resource to expand the grid

- upon ending, goes into the next level, where the grid is reset

key gameplay mechanics:

- push your luck

- engine building

- deck building

- tile placement

story/theme constraints:

2. tiles being drawn randomly, with player only controlling position of them needs to make sense

3. players purchasing new tiles to add to the deck at the shop, needs to make sense

4. all of the tiles from the deck, and those purchased from the shop, remain in the deck until the end of the run

5. the level being a blank grid which is reset between each level, needs to make sense
