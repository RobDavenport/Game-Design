Roguelike Deckbuilder, but instead of cards, dice are used.

Potential Titles:
- Boneslingers
- The Quick and the Undead
- Tumblebones
- Six-Sided-Shooters
- Dead Roll Redemption
- Snake Eyes & Skeletons
### **Core Mechanics**
**Dice Pool Management**
- Players collect different types of dice, each with unique faces representing various actions (damage, healing, blocking, etc.).
- Players can **add, upgrade, and remove** dice from their pool over time, similar to adding or removing cards from a deck in a roguelike deckbuilder.
- **Upgrading Dice:** Players can upgrade dice to have stronger or more reliable outcomes on their faces (e.g., change a "1 block" face to "3 block" or add extra effects like poison).
- **Removing Dice:** Players can remove weak or unwanted dice to focus on better, more specialized dice.
**Face Customization (Equivalent to Card Upgrading)**
- Each die face can be modified either temporarily or permanently
- Players might encounter upgrades where they can **modify individual dice faces**:
	- **Temporary Buffs:** Some modifiers only last a certain number of turns (e.g., "increase the damage by +2 for the next three rolls").
	- **Permanent Modifications:** Add new symbols, like turning a standard face into a face that blocks and applies poison simultaneously.
- This adds a layer of strategy by allowing players to **customize their dice** beyond just earning new ones.
**Relics / Artifacts**
- The game can introduce passive items (similar to relics) that affect the dice rolls or mechanics:
	- **Reroll Tokens:** A relic that gives a player one additional reroll per turn.
	- **Face Modifier Relic:** Turns one "blank" face into a face that gives +1 to all healing rolls.
	- **Conditional Relics:** A relic that triggers an effect when certain dice combinations appear (e.g., when two damage faces show up, deal an extra 5 area damage).

### **Combat Mechanics**
 **Attacking (Damage Dice)**
- Dice faces that deal various forms of damage:
	- **Single Target Damage:** A face might show a sword symbol for direct damage to one enemy.
	- **Area Damage:** Explosive or fire symbols can represent area-of-effect damage, dealing partial damage to all enemies.
	- **Scaling Damage:** Damage dice could scale based on certain conditions (e.g., "deal damage equal to the number of block faces rolled this turn").
**Defending (Block Dice)**
- Shield faces block incoming damage, but **upgraded dice faces** can add effects like **reflecting damage** or **adding temporary health**.
- **Conditional Blocking:** Some blocks might be conditional (e.g., block + heal if two dice match a condition like both rolling shields).
**Buffs and Debuffs**
- Buff faces can apply **temporary effects** to the player, like increasing all future healing or damage for the next few turns.
- Increase the effectivness of the next played dice by adding values or doubling.
- Debuffs apply status effects to enemies:
	- **Weaken Enemies:** Lower their damage or defense.
	- **Poison/Burn:** Apply damage over time.
**Combo Dice and Synergy**
- Dice rolls can unlock **combos** based on which dice faces appear together. For example, rolling two specific faces (like two damage symbols) might trigger an **extra attack** or a **chain reaction** where all enemies take damage.
- Synergies between dice rolls can incentivize specific strategies:
	- **Dice Synergy:** Rolling a heal, block, and damage dice together might trigger a “balanced” combo, where you deal damage and gain health.
	- **Face Alignment:** Rolling three of the same face (like three shields) might give a bonus effect (e.g., gain extra block).
### **Progression Mechanics**
**Dice Rewards and Unlocks**
- After battles or events, players can **choose new dice** or **upgrades** for existing dice, offering a constant sense of progression.
- Introduce **random events** where players can upgrade or mutate their dice (e.g., a shrine where you permanently turn a dice face into a healing effect but lose another face’s attack effect).
**Shop / Merchant System**
- Players can visit a shop between runs to **buy new dice**, pay to **reroll face upgrades**, or **purchase relics**, introducing more control over luck.
- Selling unwanted dice can help manage the dice pool and clear out bad dice, similar to card removal.
**Events / Shrines / Curses**
- Special events that allow dice modification or face rerolling, but with a cost (e.g., **curses** that replace one face of a die with a negative effect like "lose HP").
- Events that temporarily modify dice for a single run could add unique twists, like turning all blank faces into critical hits.

Potential Characters:
Boneslinger: Gunslinger variant
Dice Mage: Mage variant
#### Example Cards
Strike:
Cost 1
Deals X damage

Big Strike:
Cost 2
Deals X + Y damage

Risky Strike:
Cost 2
Deals X damage Y times

Block:
Cost 1
Gain X Block

Big Block:
Cost 2
Gain X + Y Block

Risky Block:
Cost 2
Gain X block Y times


If the above cards have too high variance, consider something like "Deals 6 + 1d6 damage" instead.

#### Relics/Upgrades Examples:
Replaces d6 with d8 (or d12, d20 whatever)
Lowest/Highest Dice sides get +1

Card gets + X 
Dice "Size" Upgrade (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 )
Dice "Face" Upgrades 
Dice Face when rolled Gain 1 Block
Dice Face when rolled Deal 1 Damage 

#### Mechanics:
Phantom Dice X: Rolls an additional dX along side with it and uses the value
Critical: A specific face could be deemed a crit (or upgraded). This would create some synergies for low-face dice since they could have a higher crit probability

Alternate 1:
No cards, just strict actions and dice can be allocated accordingly to attacking or blocking. Die faces must be more unique with actual spells, effects on them, like:
- Cleave effects
- Deal Damage equal to your block
This is closer to a true "roguelike dicebuilder" game

Alternate 2:
All cards are "played" each turn, instead, players just allocate dice into the cards accordingly. Cards have "slots," including 0 slots sometimes, for dice to be inserted into to add special effects. Cards may or may not be activated based on the number of dice invested in them. Can have special attribute to cards for them to "activate" even without any dice slotted.

Alternate 3:
Dice instead of cards:  
  
1. Dice themselves can be preset named objects, like cards would be, and added to the dice bag. Something like a d6, but with one 3 damage side, two 2 damage sides, and three 1 damage sides, or a block dice, or a hybrid dice which could do either. A d4 with an effect like (draw 1 card, with 1 side being draw 2). Dice, like cards, can have rarity, be upgraded and modified. Player will draw 5 dice per turn and can roll 3.
  
2. Dice are objects instead of cards, and could have a cost/something associated with them in order to roll. Either mana cost unique to each die, or a flat number of dice available to roll per turn.
