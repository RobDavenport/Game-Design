### **Core Mechanics**
**Dice Pool Management**
- Players collect different types of dice, each with unique faces representing various actions (damage, healing, blocking, etc.).
- Players can **add, upgrade, and remove** dice from their pool over time, similar to adding or removing cards from a deck in a roguelike deckbuilder.
- **Upgrading Dice:** Players can upgrade dice to have stronger or more reliable outcomes on their faces (e.g., change a "1 block" face to "3 block" or add extra effects like poison).
- **Removing Dice:** Players can remove weak or unwanted dice to focus on better, more specialized dice.
**Face Customization (Equivalent to Card Upgrading)**
- Each die face can be modified either temporarily or permanently
- Players might encounter upgrades where they can **modify individual dice faces**:
	- **Temporary Buffs:** Some modifiers only last a certain number of turns (e.g., "increase the damage by +2 for the next three rolls").
	- **Permanent Modifications:** Add new symbols, like turning a standard face into a face that blocks and applies poison simultaneously.
- This adds a layer of strategy by allowing players to **customize their dice** beyond just earning new ones.
**Relics / Artifacts**
- The game can introduce passive items (similar to relics) that affect the dice rolls or mechanics:
	- **Reroll Tokens:** A relic that gives a player one additional reroll per turn.
	- **Face Modifier Relic:** Turns one "blank" face into a face that gives +1 to all healing rolls.
	- **Conditional Relics:** A relic that triggers an effect when certain dice combinations appear (e.g., when two damage faces show up, deal an extra 5 area damage).

### **Combat Mechanics**
 **Attacking (Damage Dice)**
- Dice faces that deal various forms of damage:
	- **Single Target Damage:** A face might show a sword symbol for direct damage to one enemy.
	- **Area Damage:** Explosive or fire symbols can represent area-of-effect damage, dealing partial damage to all enemies.
	- **Scaling Damage:** Damage dice could scale based on certain conditions (e.g., "deal damage equal to the number of block faces rolled this turn").
**Defending (Block Dice)**
- Shield faces block incoming damage, but **upgraded dice faces** can add effects like **reflecting damage** or **adding temporary health**.
- **Conditional Blocking:** Some blocks might be conditional (e.g., block + heal if two dice match a condition like both rolling shields).
**Buffs and Debuffs**
- Buff faces can apply **temporary effects** to the player, like increasing all future healing or damage for the next few turns.
- Increase the effectiveness of the next played dice by adding values or doubling.
- Debuffs apply status effects to enemies:
	- **Weaken Enemies:** Lower their damage or defense.
	- **Poison/Burn:** Apply damage over time.
**Combo Dice and Synergy**
- Dice rolls can unlock **combos** based on which dice faces appear together. For example, rolling two specific faces (like two damage symbols) might trigger an **extra attack** or a **chain reaction** where all enemies take damage.
- Synergies between dice rolls can incentivize specific strategies:
	- **Dice Synergy:** Rolling a heal, block, and damage dice together might trigger a “balanced” combo, where you deal damage and gain health.
	- **Face Alignment:** Rolling three of the same face (like three shields) might give a bonus effect (e.g., gain extra block).
### **Progression Mechanics**
**Dice Rewards and Unlocks** (Boneforge)
- After battles or events, players can **choose new dice** or **upgrades** for existing dice, offering a constant sense of progression.
- Introduce **random events** where players can upgrade or mutate their dice (e.g., a shrine where you permanently turn a dice face into a healing effect but lose another face’s attack effect).
**Shop / Merchant System** (Dust Dealer)
- Players can visit a shop between runs to **buy new dice**, pay to **reroll face upgrades**, or **purchase relics**, introducing more control over luck.
- Selling unwanted dice can help manage the dice pool and clear out bad dice, similar to card removal.
**Events / Shrines / Curses**
- Special events that allow dice modification or face rerolling, but with a cost (e.g., **curses** that replace one face of a die with a negative effect like "lose HP").
- Events that temporarily modify dice for a single run could add unique twists, like turning all blank faces into critical hits.

### **Story and Setting**

In the arid wastelands of the frontier, where the sun scorches the earth and legends are born from dust, a new force has risen from the grave. Once legendary heroes and villains of the Old West, have been resurrected by dark, arcane powers. No longer bound by the constraints of life, they now wield dice carved from the bones of the fallen, each roll determining their fate in the battle between life and death.

The player takes on the role of a newly awakened hero brought back to life by a powerful necromancer. These heroes come from various backgrounds, endowed with the necromancer's magic and equipped with bone dice that hold ancient and mysterious powers. Each dice roll becomes a decisive factor in duels, battles, and quests, allowing the player to harness the power of the dead to overcome challenges and adversaries.

### **Setting:**

**The Dustlands** – A sprawling, desolate frontier where the remnants of civilization are intertwined with the supernatural. Ghost towns, haunted mines, and spectral landscapes dominate the terrain. The land is both a graveyard and a battlefield, where the living and the dead coexist in a delicate balance. The Dustlands are filled with eerie, atmospheric locations that challenge the player to survive and thrive amidst the undead.

**Grave Towns** – These spectral settlements act as hubs for the Player. They are populated by a mix of ghostly figures and other undead entities. Here, players can interact with NPCs, upgrade their dice, acquire new abilities, and undertake quests. Each town has its own unique charm and secrets, from haunted saloons to mystical shops run by the spirits of the old world.

**The Necromancer’s Citadel** – At the heart of the Dustlands lies the Necromancer's stronghold, a foreboding fortress of bone and dark magic. The Necromancer is a mysterious and enigmatic figure who has brought the players back to life, but whose true motives remain shrouded in mystery. The stronghold is both a source of power and a potential source of conflict, as players must navigate its dangers and uncover the truth behind their resurrection.

**Rivals** – Throughout the frontier, other resurrected heroes with their own agendas roam the land. These rivals might seek to challenge the player, forge alliances, or vie for control of the Dustlands. Encounters with these characters are frequent and varied, adding layers of intrigue and competition to the player's journey.

### **Tone and Atmosphere:**

Tumblebones blends a western frontier with fantasy elements. The world is both haunting and adventurous, with a tone that balances vmystical elements with moments of humor and high-stakes drama.

The gameplay involves mastering the use of dice to influence the outcomes of conflicts. Each dice roll is both a chance and a challenge, reflecting the unpredictable nature of the world in which the players live.

In this world, survival and success depend on harnessing the power of the dead, making strategic use of the mystical dice, and uncovering the mysteries of the Dustlands. Players will experience a blend of combat, exploration, and story, all driven by the enigmatic and supernatural elements of their necromantic powers.
