Roguelike Deckbuilder, but instead of "energy" to play cards, dice are used.

#### Example Cards
Strike:
Cost 1
Deals X damage

Big Strike:
Cost 2
Deals X + Y damage

Risky Strike:
Cost 2
Deals X damage Y times

Block:
Cost 1
Gain X Block

Big Block:
Cost 2
Gain X + Y Block

Risky Block:
Cost 2
Gain X block Y times


If the above cards have too high variance, consider something like "Deals 6 + 1d6 damage" instead.

#### Relics/Upgrades Examples:
Replaces d6 with d8 (or d12, d20 whatever)
Lowest/Highest Dice sides get +1

Card gets + X 
Dice "Size" Upgrade (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 )
Dice "Face" Upgrades 
Dice Face when rolled Gain 1 Block
Dice Face when rolled Deal 1 Damage 

#### Mechanics:
Phantom Dice X: Rolls an additional dX along side with it and uses the value
Critical: A specific face could be deemed a crit (or upgraded). This would create some synergies for low-face dice since they could have a higher crit probability

Alternate 1:
No cards, just strict actions and dice can be allocated accordingly to attacking or blocking. Although this seems much less exciting, with less strategy.

Alternate 2:
No block, just HP + damage. Cards have no cost, but dice can be used to "boost" the outcome, which are limited per use
