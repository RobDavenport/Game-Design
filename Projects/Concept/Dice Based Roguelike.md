Roguelike Deckbuilder, but instead of "energy" to play cards, dice are used.

#### Example Cards
Strike:
Cost 1
Deals X damage

Big Strike:
Cost 2
Deals X + Y damage

Risky Strike:
Cost 2
Deals X damage Y times

Block:
Cost 1
Gain X Block

Big Block:
Cost 2
Gain X + Y Block

Risky Block:
Cost 2
Gain X block Y times


If the above cards have too high variance, consider something like "Deals 6 + 1d6 damage" instead.

#### Relics/Upgrades Examples:
Replaces d6 with d8 (or d12, d20 whatever)
Lowest/Highest Dice sides get +1

Card gets + X 
Dice "Size" Upgrade (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20 )
Dice "Face" Upgrades 
Dice Face when rolled Gain 1 Block
Dice Face when rolled Deal 1 Damage 

#### Mechanics:
Phantom Dice X: Rolls an additional dX along side with it and uses the value
Critical: A specific face could be deemed a crit (or upgraded). This would create some synergies for low-face dice since they could have a higher crit probability

Alternate 1:
No cards, just strict actions and dice can be allocated accordingly to attacking or blocking. Card faces must be more unique with actual spells, effects on them, like:
- Cleave effects
- Deal Damage equal to your block
This is closer to a true "roguelike dicebuilder" game

Alternate 2:
All cards are "played" each turn, instead, players just allocate dice into the cards accordingly. Cards have "slots," including 0 slots sometimes, for dice to be inserted into to add special effects. Cards may or may not be activated based on the number of dice invested in them. Can have special attribute to cards for them to "activate" even without any dice slotted.

Alternate 3:
Dice instead of cards:  
  
1. Dice themselves can be preset objects, like cards and added to the dice bag. Something like a d6, but with one 3 damage side, two 2 damage sides, and three 1 damage sides, or a block dice, or a hybrid dice which could do either. Dice, like cards, can have rarity, be upgraded and modified. Player will draw 5 dice per turn and can roll 3.
  
2. Dice are objects instead of cards, and could have a cost/something associated with them in order to roll. Either mana cost unique to each die, or a flat number of dice available to roll per turn.
