## Overview

Magepunk is a fast-paced, magepunk fantasy card game where players harness **primal energies** to summon Entities, cast Spells, and activate Nodes. Players can play quick skirmish games using two **wallets** (18 cards each, shuffled together) or constructed games with full decks (36+ cards).

**Winning the Game:** Reduce your opponent’s life total to 0.

## Turn Structure

Each player’s turn consists of the following phases:

1. **Draw Phase** — Draw 1 card from your deck.

3. **Attack Phase** — Declare attacks with Entities. Opponent may block with their Entities.

## Fast Cards

- **Fast** cards may be played outside the normal turn sequence.
    
- Can be cast during an opponent’s Main, Attack, or End Phase.
    
- When a Fast card is played, it goes on a **response chain**.
    
- Players may alternate adding additional Fast cards to the chain, creating a **series of responses**.
    
- Once a player **chooses not to add a card** to the chain, the chain **resolves immediately**, last-in-first-out (LIFO).
    
- Only one response chain can exist at a time; after it resolves, normal turn play resumes.

---

## Combat and Damage

- Entities have **Impact** (attack) and **Durability** (health).
    
- During the Attack Phase, Entities may attack the opponent directly.
    
- Damage **expires at the end of the turn**; Durability resets unless specified otherwise.
    
- Life totals decrease by damage dealt to a player.
    

---

## Costs and Resources

- Cards have **generic costs** plus color-specific costs.
    
- Most cards may be played upside-down as a **resource of their color**.
    
- Resources **refresh at the start of each turn**.
    
- One card can generate one resource per turn unless otherwise specified.

## Abilities

Entities and Nodes may have **abilities** that allow additional actions beyond attacking, blocking, or basic effects. There are two main types:

### 1. **Activated Abilities**

- Abilities you **choose to activate** by paying a cost.
    
- Example: “Pay 1 Biom → Generate 1 Biom resource.”
    
- Some activated abilities may have the **Fast** keyword, allowing them to be used **outside your turn** (during your opponent’s phase).
    
- Activated abilities can be used once per activation unless specified otherwise.
    

### 2. **Triggered Abilities**

- Abilities that **automatically trigger** when a specific event occurs.
    
- Example: “When this Entity deals damage, draw 1 card.”
    
- Triggered abilities **always resolve when their condition is met**; they cannot be Fast.
    

### 3. **Fast Keyword**

- Any **Spell or Activated Ability** marked **Fast** can be added to a **response chain**.
    
- Players alternate adding Fast effects to the chain.
    
- Once a player declines to add a card/ability to the chain, it **resolves immediately in last-in-first-out (LIFO) order**.

## Notes

- The rules are designed to **keep gameplay simple and fast**, while allowing flexibility for future expansions.
    
- Subtypes (e.g., cyborg, wizard, beast) can be added to Entities, Nodes, and Spells to provide flavor and mechanical variety.
    
- The **Fast keyword** allows reactive play without the complexity of a full stack system.
