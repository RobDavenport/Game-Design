# Magepunk — World Bible (compact)

## High-level elevator pitch

A world where primal magical energies power industry, war, and life itself. Cities are stitched from wrought iron and living vine; pistols belch flame borne of Kinesis; living biotic constructs grow like coral from factory hulls. The five primal energies (Biom, Kinesis, Aether, Entropy, Radiance) are everywhere — raw forces that mages, guilds, and machines tap, bargain with, and occasionally tear apart. The setting supports both quick skirmish stories (two wallets shuffled = an instant clash) and deeper factional politics for constructed play.
