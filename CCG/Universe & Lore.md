# Magepunk — World Bible (compact)

## High-level elevator pitch

A world where primal magical energies power industry, war, and life itself. Cities are stitched from wrought iron and living vine; pistols belch flame borne of Kinesis; living biotic constructs grow like coral from factory hulls. The five primal energies (Biom, Kinesis, Aether, Entropy, Radiance) are everywhere — raw forces that mages, guilds, and machines tap, bargain with, and occasionally tear apart. The setting supports both quick skirmish stories (two wallets shuffled = an instant clash) and deeper factional politics for constructed play.

## ## **Biom — The Living Force**

**World-Facing:**  
Biom is the raw currency of life: a malleable bio-substrate that grafts to machines, heals wounds, and grows devices as readily as it grows forests. Its practitioners range from biotech tinkerers who fuse living tissue with pistons to mystics who coax fungi into living structures. Biom sees all life — animal, plant, fungal, or engineered — as part of a single continuum. In magepunk cities, Biom powers self-repairing devices and adaptive infrastructure, and its wielders manipulate life energy to sustain, enhance, or restore.

**Mechanics:**

- **Primary:** Healing and restoration effects — repair units, mend damaged equipment, or restore lost energy.
    
- **Secondary:** Growth and enhancement — cards that improve over time or interact synergistically with other Biom-powered elements.
    
- **Tertiary:** Adaptive strategies — cards that change function depending on board state or interactions with other Biom elements.

## **Kinesis — Force & Momentum**

**World-Facing:**  
Kinesis embodies motion itself: gravity, friction, and raw kinetic power. Its wielders are athletes, engineers, and inventors who harness energy to move, strike, or explode with precision. Kinesis creates heat and combustion as a natural side effect, making its practitioners adept at both fast attacks and building momentum over time. In play, Kinesis encourages rapid, aggressive actions and rewards chaining efforts to build unstoppable force.

**Mechanics:**

- **Primary:** Speed and aggression — effects that act quickly, initiate sudden strikes, or accelerate other actions.
    
- **Secondary:** Momentum-based growth — abilities that increase in impact as actions are repeated or linked together.
    
- **Tertiary:** Physical manipulation — move objects, push or reposition units, or trigger effects tied to movement or momentum.

## **Aether — Mastery over Uncertainty**

**World-Facing:**  
Aether represents the controlled manipulation of raw energy. Scholars, psychics, and reality hackers study the flow of the unknown to anticipate and bend outcomes. It prizes setup, planning, and exploiting potential, rewarding those who can foresee consequences. Magepunk Aether devices predict and influence events, turning chaotic energy into precise advantage.

**Mechanics:**

- **Primary:** Preparation and foresight — look ahead, arrange resources, or manipulate the next effects to come.
    
- **Secondary:** Conditional control — temporarily redirect actions, delay effects, or neutralize threats when specific conditions are met.
    
- **Tertiary:** Strategic advantage — rewards careful planning or skillful sequencing rather than raw power.

## **Entropy — The Primal Tide of Change**

**World-Facing:**  
Entropy is the universe’s relentless pulse: everything unravels, corrodes, and transforms. It is neither good nor evil — it simply **is**. Its wielders — scavengers, alchemists, and daring engineers — learn to **ride this tide**, using inevitable collapse to create opportunity, trigger innovation, or redirect energy. In magepunk cities, decaying engines, unstable biotech, and crumbling towers are not just hazards but **resources to be harnessed**. To master Entropy is to respect the primal force of change, and to use what would otherwise be loss to gain temporary advantage, create space, or spark new possibilities.

**Mechanics:**

- **Primary:** Inevitable decay — natural, ongoing degradation of units, devices, or resources.
    
- **Secondary:** Harnessing collapse — gain immediate benefit or trigger effects from events that others might see as destructive.
    
- **Tertiary:** Transformative chaos — the destabilized battlefield creates new opportunities, rewarding timing, foresight, and creative exploitation.

## **Radiance — Primal Awe & Intervention**

**World-Facing:**  
Radiance is divine energy manifesting in awe-inspiring effects. Its wielders — from zealots to faith-driven engineers — channel the power of belief, sometimes invoking miraculous events. Radiance uplifts, punishes, or protects through interventions that feel larger than the practitioner. In magepunk cities, Radiance manifests as sudden bursts of power, protective shields, and dramatic effects that inspire or enforce ideals.

**Mechanics:**

- **Primary:** Miraculous intervention — sudden, impactful effects that restore, protect, or decisively shift situations.
    
- **Secondary:** Enforcement — prevent negative outcomes or impose consequences when principles are broken.
    
- **Tertiary:** Supportive inspiration — enhance allies or systems under your control, often triggered by the player’s intention or preparation.
