# Magepunk — World Bible (compact)

## High-level elevator pitch
A world where primal magical energies power industry, war, and life itself. Cities are stitched from wrought iron and living vine; pistols belch flame borne of Kinesis; living biotic constructs grow like coral from factory hulls. The five primal energies (Biom, Kinesis, Aether, Entropy, Radiance) are everywhere — raw forces that mages, guilds, and machines tap, bargain with, and occasionally tear apart. The setting supports both quick skirmish stories (two wallets shuffled = an instant clash) and deeper factional politics for constructed play.

### Biom — The Living Force
**World-facing.**  
Biom is the raw substrate of life: a flexible, self-repairing energy that grows, heals, and adapts. Practitioners include biotech tinkerers who graft living tissue to machines and grove-keepers who steer fungal networks and symbiotic organisms. Biom treats all living systems — animal, plant, fungal, engineered organism — as facets of the same living continuum. In the cityscape Biom powers self-repairing hulls, living scaffolds, and medical rites; its practitioners coax life into new forms or mend what was broken. Biom is not sentimental: it is the pragmatic manipulation of life’s resilience.
**Mechanics.**
- **Primary:** Healing & restoration — effects that repair units, restore lost vitality, or recover spent systems.
- **Secondary:** Progressive enhancement — abilities that increase in effectiveness over time or through successful upkeep.
- **Tertiary:** Symbiotic interactions — benefits that appear when Biom elements are combined, or that shift function based on the living systems present.

### Kinesis — Force & Momentum
**World-facing.**  
Kinesis is the embodied power of motion: stored force, impact, heat and the sudden release of energy. Its wielders range from sprinting combatants to siege engineers and explosive technicians. Kinesis produces heat and shock as a matter of course—its devices kick and its warriors push — and it prizes action and timing. In battles Kinesis accelerates, punishes hesitation, and trades longevity for immediate change. It is about getting the world moving and letting motion do the work.
**Mechanics.**
- **Primary:** Speed & tempo — effects that act immediately, enable extra actions, or accelerate outcomes.
- **Secondary:** Momentum growth — abilities whose potency rises when actions are chained or repeated in sequence.
- **Tertiary:** Physical manipulation — effects that reposition elements, force interactions, or change the ordering of events.

### Aether — Mastery Over Uncertainty
**World-facing.**  
Aether is the practiced craft of foresight and control: the study and shaping of potential rather than blunt force. Its practitioners are scholars, reality-hackers, and arcane engineers who learn how events are likely to unfold and then arrange them to their advantage. Aether rewards setup, timing, and sequencing — it is not luck, it is preparation made manifest. In cities Aether drives predictive displays and timing engines; in play it lets a skilled operator create windows of opportunity and exploit them with precision.
**Mechanics.**
- **Primary:** Preparation & sequencing — look-ahead effects, ordering tools, and ways to shape upcoming resources or events.
- **Secondary:** Conditional control — temporary interruption, redirection, or neutralization of an effect when conditions are met.
- **Tertiary:** Skill rewards — abilities that pay back when the player arranges the right state or fulfills predefined conditions.

### Entropy — The Primal Tide of Change
**World-facing.**  
Entropy is the universe’s tendency toward transformation and dissolution: the slow wearing, the sudden collapse, the ineffable urge that returns order to raw components. It is neither malevolent nor benevolent; it is fundamental. Those who work with Entropy—scavengers, alchemists, and adaptive engineers—learn to read where structures will fail and to harvest the moment of collapse. In a magepunk metropolis, collapsing engines and corroded circuits are as much a material as ore: decay itself becomes a resource when anticipated and guided. Entropy offers destructive power, but also opening and renewal for those willing to accept impermanence.
**Mechanics.**
- **Primary:** Inevitable degradation — effects that reliably reduce or impair systems over time or under particular pressures.
- **Secondary:** Harvest from loss — immediate gains or triggers that follow destruction, breakdown, or surrender of resources.
- **Tertiary:** Escalating dynamics — effects that magnify as the environment destabilizes, rewarding timing and acceptance of impermanence.

### Radiance — Primal Awe & Intervention
**World-facing.**  
Radiance is raw luminous intervention: moments where forces larger than individual intent reshape events. Practitioners—clerics, votaries, ritual engineers—call for aid rather than fabricate it; sometimes the world answers. Radiant phenomena are spectacular and often communal: healing tides, sudden fortifications, or overwhelming retribution can appear like miracles. Radiance is about invoking power and creating moments of awe that alter the course of conflict. It is not moralizing: its effects are powerful and impartial, available to those who can reach them.
**Mechanics.**
- **Primary:** Intervention & reversal — sudden, high-impact effects that restore, protect, or dramatically shift the board state.
- **Secondary:** Enforcement & consequence — prevention of negative outcomes or imposition of penalties when conditions are violated.
- **Tertiary:** Communal inspiration — broad, short-lived enhancements that elevate allied systems when invoked.
