Classes are often the broadest denominator when discussing games which feature a wide variety of playstyles and [[Character Roles]]. In some games, classes may instead be named characters.

# Class Selection Systems
## None
Classes are not picked by the player, but are instead defined by other means. Often, this kind of system heavily relies on [[Horizontal Progression]] to create fun and interesting decisions.

## Onset
Classes are picked at character creation or beginning of the game, and cannot be changed at a later date. 

## Class Swapping
Can change at specific times only. Flexibility of this system depends on the game, such as only in safe, non-combat areas. This can also be considered a form of [[Horizontal Progression]] depending on the game.
