In multiplayer games, its common to have set responsibilities for each player.  These can be divided up based interactions between enemies and allies. Note that primary enemy to enemy interactions does not exist. Of course, some classes will have aspects of multiple roles available to them. In others, roles may be flexible and even be swappable during gameplay, such as via [[Horizontal Progression#Progression Systems#Specialization / Builds]].

# Roles
## Controller
Controllers are primarily responsible for **Enemy to Ally** interactions. Their main job is to reduce randomness and add stability to the encounter.

### Tank
Tanks are one of the most common types of controllers. They accomplish their role by prioritizing gaining the attention of enemies. They take the brunt of the enemy's attacks, which when paired strong defensive stats, reduce the enemy's overall effectiveness. By holding the focus of enemies, Tanks can heavily reduce the incoming damage for the entire party.

### Disabler
Disablers are classes which focus on preventing certain actions of enemies. This is often through strong, crowd control style status effects, such as snares, slows, disarms, and silences. These powerful status effects can often severely reduce the impact of enemies over the course of an encounter, and in some cases remove them for the entirety of it.

## Supports
Supports are primarily responsible for **Ally to Ally** interactions.  Their main job is to provide force multiplication for their allies. Support's main mechanics are often very unique to each game and genre.

### Healer
Healers are a common type of supporter. Their main purpose is to heal any damage taken by the party (especially the Tank) and allow them to fight for extended periods of time. In a typical game, healers could be simplified as converting the healer's resource (such as mana) into hit points for the party.

### Supporter
In a general sense, a Supporter is a character who strengthens a party's offensive or defensive capabilities through indirect means. This is often in the form of offensive buffs, such as damage increases, as well as defensive buffs, such as reducing incoming damage. 

### Enabler
Enablers are supporters whose main purpose is to create new and unique opportunities for their allies. There are a wide range of ways this can be done, some of which can be done through non-traditional means, such as: improved movement capabilities, initiation tools, or creating/extending high value opportunity windows.

## Damage Dealers
Damage Dealers are primarily responsible for **Ally to Enemy** interactions. Their main job is to progress the fight (usually through damage) in the most efficient manner.
