Defines how characters increase in power level vertically. These systems are not mutually exclusive, so a game can feature many of these at once.
This differs from [[Horizontal Progression]] primarily in that vertical progression directly affects a players power level, and is intended to do so. They directly affect a characters ability to perform their [[Character Roles]] via a pure numerical advantage.

# Vertical Progression Systems
## None
Characters do not increase in power vertically.

## Linear
Set progression which is the same for all of the same class. The player is not able to make many (if any) meaningful choices to how their character itself scales vertically. This is often done via character levels, or skill levels, which increase naturally as the player plays the game.

## Advancement Classes
Characters can advance to a new, previously unavailable character class. Often requires achieving some pre-requisite such as level. Advancement classes may be permanent, and players may be offered singular or multiple choices based on their [[Class Selection]].

## Item / Equipment Based
Items equipped to the character increase the power level. Often this is things such as armor or weapons found by playing the game via clearing content, defeating enemies, or crafting. The items themselves can often be improved as well, such as via sockets for stat boosts, enchantments, or upgrades. Also see [[Equipment Progression]].

## Usage Based
Players can increase their power by simply using the ability or skill. This could have some connection to items or abilities which are given to the player by other means.

## Player Influenced Points
The player can selectively increase certain stats of the character. This can come from specific points in attributes, or via some kind of [[Skill Trees]] which provides power-increasing effects via passive or new active effects and abilities. These can be presented in a variety of ways, with some being mutually exclusive choices, or having a limited capacity.
