# House Style Design (Revised)
This visual identity fuses structural exaggeration with disciplined clarity and electric confidence. Characters are built around bold, high-impact silhouettes that read instantly at a glance. Proportions are amplified in deliberate ways — powerful shoulders, sculpted legs, dramatic collars, elongated limbs, or striking hair shapes — but always controlled by clean value separation and strong outer contours. Exaggeration is architectural, not chaotic. Each character carries one dominant visual statement that anchors their presence and makes them unforgettable.

The aesthetic embraces provocative confidence without crossing into explicit territory. Physiques are sculpted and athletic, with visible strength and deliberate form. Outfits are constructed to frame the body rather than conceal it — cropped jackets, high-cut designs, exposed midriffs, open harness elements, or layered fabrics that accentuate muscle and movement. Skin exposure is intentional and stylish, never gratuitous. Every design choice serves characterization: a blindfold implies mystery, an open back implies fearlessness, heeled boots imply defiance. The energy should feel self-assured and dominant, as if the character is fully aware of their physical presence and wields it as part of their identity.

The emotional register is electric and alive. These are characters who enjoy the fight, not endure it. Even brooding or serious archetypes carry an underlying vitality — they may be dangerous, but they are never defeated. The world these fighters inhabit is one of energy, spectacle, and presence, not melancholy or ruin.

Surface design leans into fashion authority rather than superhero uniformity. Textiles dominate over armor; tailoring, seams, straps, and material contrast add sophistication and edge. Hardware and tech elements are integrated sparingly to enhance structure, not overwhelm it. The overall tone blends high-fashion runway attitude with arena-ready combat readiness — sharp, composed, and unapologetically bold.

Color is vibrant, graphic, and celebratory — never muddy, never muted. Each character follows a disciplined palette anchored by strong dark–light contrast and one high-saturation accent that commands attention. The chroma runs hot: saturated and energetic, but controlled enough that characters feel striking rather than toy-like. Color should feel like a statement, not a mood — it announces the character before anything else does.

When executed correctly, the result is provocative yet tasteful, vivid yet disciplined: larger-than-life fighters who radiate power, confidence, and allure while feeling unmistakably alive. This is sensuality with swagger, fashion with teeth, and color that hits like a spotlight — all held within the bounds of a mature mainstream action game.

# House Style Design (Revised 2.0)

This visual identity fuses structural exaggeration with electric confidence. Characters are built around bold, high-impact silhouettes that read instantly at a glance and linger in memory long after. Proportions are amplified in _committed_ ways — powerful shoulders, sculpted legs, dramatic collars, elongated limbs, or striking hair shapes — pushed past realism into the territory of visual iconography. Each character carries **one dominant visual absurdity**: a signature element that is logically excessive but emotionally perfect. This could be an oversized accessory, an impossible weapon, a garment worn in a way that defies convention, a piece of anatomy pushed to its expressive limit, or a design "sin" elevated into a statement. This signature element is non-negotiable — it is the thing people remember, cosplay, and draw fan art of. Without it, the character is incomplete. **This signature must be identifiable in isolation** — recognizable even when separated from the full costume, reducible to a single iconic prop, silhouette fragment, or accessory that immediately evokes the character (a blindfold, an anchor, a giant collar, a segmented gauntlet cluster). If the signature only works in context of the full design, it is not strong enough. **A character should not feel like a collection of strong design choices. It should feel like one overwhelming idea executed relentlessly.** The dominant absurdity must clearly overpower all secondary design elements — it is the sun around which everything else orbits. Secondary elements exist to support, frame, and amplify the primary statement, not to compete with it. If multiple elements vie equally for attention, the design lacks hierarchy and focus, and the character will be _interesting_ rather than _iconic_. Interesting is not the goal. Obsessive singularity is.

**Silhouette must be extreme and specific.** When reduced to a solid black shape, every character should be instantly distinguishable — not through subtle variation, but through genuinely dramatic difference. **At least one design element must occupy roughly 25–40% of the character's total silhouette mass or visual weight.** This may be a weapon, hair volume, coat tail, collar, shoulder mass, limb exaggeration, or anatomical distortion. If no single element dominates at this scale, the design is underdeveloped. Achieve this extreme silhouette through scale contrast within the design itself: pair something massive with something exposed, something voluminous with something skin-tight, something heavy with something that defies gravity. Asymmetry is a primary tool — one oversized sleeve, one bare arm; armor on one leg, nothing on the other; a cape that only drapes to one side. Symmetry is earned through deliberate choice, not default. **The silhouette itself should imply a direction of travel, not just a shape.** Elements may angle, drag, flare, or arc in ways that suggest force, momentum, or tension — coat tails that imply wind, hair angled permanently as if caught mid-motion, a weapon that pulls posture off-center, straps that hang diagonally, geometry that tilts. The design should feel like it was captured in a moment of kinetic energy. A static, upright, perfectly balanced stance should feel wrong for these characters; even at rest, the silhouette should suggest that movement is about to happen or has just occurred.

**Anatomy is exaggerated per character, not generically athletic.** Each character's physicality is a statement tuned to their identity. One character may have exaggerated forearms and thick hands that communicate raw power. Another may have impossibly long legs that communicate predatory elegance. Another may be a wall of muscle that borders on architectural. "Fit" is the floor, not the ceiling — the question is always _what specific physical quality is turned up to 11 for this person?_ Visible musculature, pronounced joints, exaggerated v-tapers, sculpted thighs, powerful necks — these are tools of characterization, deployed individually rather than applied uniformly. **Neutral, mid-range builds are prohibited.** Avoid default anime protagonist proportions — the lean, moderately toned, medium-height frame that could belong to anyone. Every character must commit to a physical direction: either amplify mass (heavier musculature, thicker limbs, bulkier structure) or amplify elegance (longer limbs, narrower waist, sharper geometry). A mid-range build is only acceptable if the design's extremity is loaded entirely elsewhere — and even then, something about the body itself should feel _specific_ rather than generic.

**If the character uses a weapon, its scale or form must be visually unconventional.** Oversized, structurally strange, asymmetrical, architecturally stylized, or functionally absurd. Standard sword, katana, and spear silhouettes are not permitted unless heavily modified to the point of near-unrecognizability. A weapon should be as much a character design element as the outfit itself — it participates in the silhouette, contributes to the 25–40% visual weight threshold, and reinforces the character's identity. A generic weapon is a missed opportunity and a design failure.

**Outfits are constructed to provoke, not merely to frame.** Clothing should feel like it was designed by someone who understood fashion rules and then strategically broke them. Cropped jackets, high-cut designs, exposed midriffs, open backs, harness elements, and layered fabrics that accentuate muscle and movement — all of these remain core tools. But push further: belts that serve no structural purpose but add visual rhythm and excess. Collars or coattails that are dramatically oversized. Zippers, buckles, and straps that exist for visual density rather than function. Garments worn incorrectly on purpose — a jacket used as a cape, sleeves rolled to different heights, a shirt left strategically undone. Every outfit should have at least one element that a fashion editor would call "too much" — that excess is what makes it a fighting game design rather than a runway look. The fashion sensibility itself should feel _alien and deliberate_ — not superhero spandex, not standard fantasy armor, but something closer to avant-garde runway pieces adapted for violence. Blindfolds in combat. Heeled boots on brawlers. Evening wear cut for a street fight. The strangeness of these choices is a feature, not a contradiction; the design should feel like it emerged from a world with its own internal fashion logic that doesn't answer to ours. Skin exposure is intentional and confident; it communicates self-assurance and dominance, as if the character is fully aware of their physical presence and weaponizes it.

**The emotional register is electric, unrestrained, and alive.** These are characters who enjoy the fight, not endure it. Even brooding or serious archetypes carry a crackling undercurrent of vitality — they may be dangerous, but they are never defeated and never boring. The energy should feel like a dare: confrontational beauty, playful menace, or magnetic arrogance. Characters should look like they _chose_ to look this way — not costumed by circumstance, but self-styled with intention and attitude. The confidence is the point — every design choice, no matter how excessive, reads as deliberate because the character wearing it owns it completely.

**Surface design leans into fashion authority layered with deliberate excess.** Textiles dominate over armor; tailoring, seams, straps, and material contrast add sophistication and edge. But where the fashion world would stop, keep going — add another layer, another strap, another texture break. Hardware and tech elements are integrated as visual punctuation: not overwhelming, but present enough to remind the viewer this is a combatant, not a model. **The design should not feel uniformly polished.** At least one area should introduce deliberate visual friction — density against emptiness, hard mechanical detail against soft fabric, elegant anatomy against brutish hardware, or refined tailoring interrupted by aggressive clutter. A pristine, fashion-editorial smoothness across the entire design signals that it hasn't been pushed far enough. Tension between elements — the feeling that two opposing design philosophies are coexisting within a single character through sheer force of confidence — is what elevates a "good design" into an _unforgettable_ one. The tone blends high-fashion runway attitude with arena-ready spectacle — sharp, composed, and unapologetically over-the-top.

**Color is vibrant, graphic, and aggressive** — never muddy, never muted, never safe. Each character follows a disciplined palette anchored by strong dark–light contrast and at least one high-saturation accent that hits like a spotlight. The chroma runs hot and celebratory: saturated, energetic, and joyful in its boldness, used in confident graphic blocks rather than gentle gradients. Colors should pop with an almost candy-bright intensity — electric pinks, screaming teals, vivid oranges, deep magentas — tempered only by strong darks (true blacks, deep navy, rich burgundy) that give the bright tones room to sing. The palette should feel like a party that takes itself seriously: exuberant and loud, but never cheap or toy-like, because the underlying value structure and contrast ratios are doing real compositional work. Color should feel like a declaration — it announces the character before anything else does, and it should be visible from across an arena.

**The litmus tests.** A design is not finished until it passes all four:

1. **The Silhouette Weight Test.** Reduce the character to a solid black shape. Is there at least one element that commands 25–40% of the total visual mass? Can you identify the character from the silhouette alone — not from subtle cues, but from genuinely dramatic shape difference? Does the silhouette imply direction and energy rather than static balance? If not, the design needs more commitment.
2. **The Uncomfortable Commitment Test.** Look at the design as a whole. Does it feel completely safe, balanced, or reasonable at first glance? If yes, something is missing. At least one element should feel slightly excessive, impractical, or audacious — something that provokes a moment of "that's too much" before resolving into cohesion upon closer inspection. Similarly, the design should contain at least one point of visual friction where competing elements create productive tension. Comfort and uniform polish are the enemies of memorability.
3. **The Isolation Test.** Remove the character's body. Take only the signature element — the weapon, the accessory, the hair, the garment detail. Is it recognizable on its own? Could someone identify the character from this fragment alone? If the signature only works as part of the whole, it is not iconic enough.
4. **The Hierarchy Test.** Look at the design and ask: what is this character _about?_ If the answer is a list — "well, they have a big collar AND long legs AND an interesting weapon AND cool asymmetry" — the design lacks focus. The answer should be one thing, stated immediately and confidently, with everything else clearly subordinate. One idea, pushed to obsession. Everything else in service.

If a character could pass as a design from a non-combat game, or could be swapped into a generic anime without looking out of place, the design is not finished. Every character should look like they belong in a world of spectacle — provocative yet tasteful, vivid yet intentional, excessive yet coherent. These are larger-than-life fighters who radiate power, confidence, and allure while feeling unmistakably _alive_. Sensuality with swagger, fashion with teeth, anatomy with attitude, color that celebrates itself, and one obsessive idea that survives all four tests above.
