# House Style Design (Revised)
This visual identity fuses structural exaggeration with disciplined clarity and electric confidence. Characters are built around bold, high-impact silhouettes that read instantly at a glance. Proportions are amplified in deliberate ways — powerful shoulders, sculpted legs, dramatic collars, elongated limbs, or striking hair shapes — but always controlled by clean value separation and strong outer contours. Exaggeration is architectural, not chaotic. Each character carries one dominant visual statement that anchors their presence and makes them unforgettable.

The aesthetic embraces provocative confidence without crossing into explicit territory. Physiques are sculpted and athletic, with visible strength and deliberate form. Outfits are constructed to frame the body rather than conceal it — cropped jackets, high-cut designs, exposed midriffs, open harness elements, or layered fabrics that accentuate muscle and movement. Skin exposure is intentional and stylish, never gratuitous. Every design choice serves characterization: a blindfold implies mystery, an open back implies fearlessness, heeled boots imply defiance. The energy should feel self-assured and dominant, as if the character is fully aware of their physical presence and wields it as part of their identity.

The emotional register is electric and alive. These are characters who enjoy the fight, not endure it. Even brooding or serious archetypes carry an underlying vitality — they may be dangerous, but they are never defeated. The world these fighters inhabit is one of energy, spectacle, and presence, not melancholy or ruin.

Surface design leans into fashion authority rather than superhero uniformity. Textiles dominate over armor; tailoring, seams, straps, and material contrast add sophistication and edge. Hardware and tech elements are integrated sparingly to enhance structure, not overwhelm it. The overall tone blends high-fashion runway attitude with arena-ready combat readiness — sharp, composed, and unapologetically bold.

Color is vibrant, graphic, and celebratory — never muddy, never muted. Each character follows a disciplined palette anchored by strong dark–light contrast and one high-saturation accent that commands attention. The chroma runs hot: saturated and energetic, but controlled enough that characters feel striking rather than toy-like. Color should feel like a statement, not a mood — it announces the character before anything else does.

When executed correctly, the result is provocative yet tasteful, vivid yet disciplined: larger-than-life fighters who radiate power, confidence, and allure while feeling unmistakably alive. This is sensuality with swagger, fashion with teeth, and color that hits like a spotlight — all held within the bounds of a mature mainstream action game.

# House Style Design (Revised 2.0)

This visual identity fuses structural exaggeration with electric confidence. Characters are built around bold, high-impact silhouettes that read instantly at a glance and linger in memory long after. Proportions are amplified in _committed_ ways — powerful shoulders, sculpted legs, dramatic collars, elongated limbs, or striking hair shapes — pushed past realism into the territory of visual iconography. Each character carries **one dominant visual absurdity**: a signature element that is logically excessive but emotionally perfect. This could be an oversized accessory, an impossible weapon, a garment worn in a way that defies convention, a piece of anatomy pushed to its expressive limit, or a design "sin" elevated into a statement. This signature element is non-negotiable — it is the thing people remember, cosplay, and draw fan art of. Without it, the character is incomplete. **This signature must be identifiable in isolation** — recognizable even when separated from the full costume, reducible to a single iconic prop, silhouette fragment, or accessory that immediately evokes the character (a blindfold, an anchor, a giant collar, a segmented gauntlet cluster). If the signature only works in context of the full design, it is not strong enough. **A character should not feel like a collection of strong design choices. It should feel like one overwhelming idea executed relentlessly.** The dominant absurdity must clearly overpower all secondary design elements — it is the sun around which everything else orbits. Secondary elements exist to support, frame, and amplify the primary statement, not to compete with it. If multiple elements vie equally for attention, the design lacks hierarchy and focus, and the character will be _interesting_ rather than _iconic_. Interesting is not the goal. Obsessive singularity is.

**Silhouette must be extreme and specific.** When reduced to a solid black shape, every character should be instantly distinguishable — not through subtle variation, but through genuinely dramatic difference. **At least one design element must occupy roughly 25–40% of the character's total silhouette mass or visual weight.** This may be a weapon, hair volume, coat tail, collar, shoulder mass, limb exaggeration, or anatomical distortion. If no single element dominates at this scale, the design is underdeveloped. Achieve this extreme silhouette through scale contrast within the design itself: pair something massive with something exposed, something voluminous with something skin-tight, something heavy with something that defies gravity. Asymmetry is a primary tool — one oversized sleeve, one bare arm; armor on one leg, nothing on the other; a cape that only drapes to one side. Symmetry is earned through deliberate choice, not default. **The silhouette itself should imply a direction of travel, not just a shape.** Elements may angle, drag, flare, or arc in ways that suggest force, momentum, or tension — coat tails that imply wind, hair angled permanently as if caught mid-motion, a weapon that pulls posture off-center, straps that hang diagonally, geometry that tilts. The design should feel like it was captured in a moment of kinetic energy. A static, upright, perfectly balanced stance should feel wrong for these characters; even at rest, the silhouette should suggest that movement is about to happen or has just occurred.

**Anatomy is exaggerated per character, not generically athletic.** Each character's physicality is a statement tuned to their identity. One character may have exaggerated forearms and thick hands that communicate raw power. Another may have impossibly long legs that communicate predatory elegance. Another may be a wall of muscle that borders on architectural. "Fit" is the floor, not the ceiling — the question is always _what specific physical quality is turned up to 11 for this person?_ Visible musculature, pronounced joints, exaggerated v-tapers, sculpted thighs, powerful necks — these are tools of characterization, deployed individually rather than applied uniformly. **Neutral, mid-range builds are prohibited.** Avoid default anime protagonist proportions — the lean, moderately toned, medium-height frame that could belong to anyone. Every character must commit to a physical direction: either amplify mass (heavier musculature, thicker limbs, bulkier structure) or amplify elegance (longer limbs, narrower waist, sharper geometry). A mid-range build is only acceptable if the design's extremity is loaded entirely elsewhere — and even then, something about the body itself should feel _specific_ rather than generic.

**If the character uses a weapon, its scale or form must be visually unconventional.** Oversized, structurally strange, asymmetrical, architecturally stylized, or functionally absurd. Standard sword, katana, and spear silhouettes are not permitted unless heavily modified to the point of near-unrecognizability. A weapon should be as much a character design element as the outfit itself — it participates in the silhouette, contributes to the 25–40% visual weight threshold, and reinforces the character's identity. A generic weapon is a missed opportunity and a design failure.

**Outfits are constructed to provoke, not merely to frame.** Clothing should feel like it was designed by someone who understood fashion rules and then strategically broke them. Cropped jackets, high-cut designs, exposed midriffs, open backs, harness elements, and layered fabrics that accentuate muscle and movement — all of these remain core tools. But push further: belts that serve no structural purpose but add visual rhythm and excess. Collars or coattails that are dramatically oversized. Zippers, buckles, and straps that exist for visual density rather than function. Garments worn incorrectly on purpose — a jacket used as a cape, sleeves rolled to different heights, a shirt left strategically undone. Every outfit should have at least one element that a fashion editor would call "too much" — that excess is what makes it a fighting game design rather than a runway look. The fashion sensibility itself should feel _alien and deliberate_ — not superhero spandex, not standard fantasy armor, but something closer to avant-garde runway pieces adapted for violence. Blindfolds in combat. Heeled boots on brawlers. Evening wear cut for a street fight. The strangeness of these choices is a feature, not a contradiction; the design should feel like it emerged from a world with its own internal fashion logic that doesn't answer to ours. Skin exposure is intentional and confident; it communicates self-assurance and dominance, as if the character is fully aware of their physical presence and weaponizes it.

**The emotional register is electric, unrestrained, and alive.** These are characters who enjoy the fight, not endure it. Even brooding or serious archetypes carry a crackling undercurrent of vitality — they may be dangerous, but they are never defeated and never boring. The energy should feel like a dare: confrontational beauty, playful menace, or magnetic arrogance. Characters should look like they _chose_ to look this way — not costumed by circumstance, but self-styled with intention and attitude. The confidence is the point — every design choice, no matter how excessive, reads as deliberate because the character wearing it owns it completely.

**Surface design leans into fashion authority layered with deliberate excess.** Textiles dominate over armor; tailoring, seams, straps, and material contrast add sophistication and edge. But where the fashion world would stop, keep going — add another layer, another strap, another texture break. Hardware and tech elements are integrated as visual punctuation: not overwhelming, but present enough to remind the viewer this is a combatant, not a model. **The design should not feel uniformly polished.** At least one area should introduce deliberate visual friction — density against emptiness, hard mechanical detail against soft fabric, elegant anatomy against brutish hardware, or refined tailoring interrupted by aggressive clutter. A pristine, fashion-editorial smoothness across the entire design signals that it hasn't been pushed far enough. Tension between elements — the feeling that two opposing design philosophies are coexisting within a single character through sheer force of confidence — is what elevates a "good design" into an _unforgettable_ one. The tone blends high-fashion runway attitude with arena-ready spectacle — sharp, composed, and unapologetically over-the-top.

**Color is vibrant, graphic, and aggressive** — never muddy, never muted, never safe. Each character follows a disciplined palette anchored by strong dark–light contrast and at least one high-saturation accent that hits like a spotlight. The chroma runs hot and celebratory: saturated, energetic, and joyful in its boldness, used in confident graphic blocks rather than gentle gradients. Colors should pop with an almost candy-bright intensity — electric pinks, screaming teals, vivid oranges, deep magentas — tempered only by strong darks (true blacks, deep navy, rich burgundy) that give the bright tones room to sing. The palette should feel like a party that takes itself seriously: exuberant and loud, but never cheap or toy-like, because the underlying value structure and contrast ratios are doing real compositional work. Color should feel like a declaration — it announces the character before anything else does, and it should be visible from across an arena.

**The litmus tests.** A design is not finished until it passes all four:

1. **The Silhouette Weight Test.** Reduce the character to a solid black shape. Is there at least one element that commands 25–40% of the total visual mass? Can you identify the character from the silhouette alone — not from subtle cues, but from genuinely dramatic shape difference? Does the silhouette imply direction and energy rather than static balance? If not, the design needs more commitment.
2. **The Uncomfortable Commitment Test.** Look at the design as a whole. Does it feel completely safe, balanced, or reasonable at first glance? If yes, something is missing. At least one element should feel slightly excessive, impractical, or audacious — something that provokes a moment of "that's too much" before resolving into cohesion upon closer inspection. Similarly, the design should contain at least one point of visual friction where competing elements create productive tension. Comfort and uniform polish are the enemies of memorability.
3. **The Isolation Test.** Remove the character's body. Take only the signature element — the weapon, the accessory, the hair, the garment detail. Is it recognizable on its own? Could someone identify the character from this fragment alone? If the signature only works as part of the whole, it is not iconic enough.
4. **The Hierarchy Test.** Look at the design and ask: what is this character _about?_ If the answer is a list — "well, they have a big collar AND long legs AND an interesting weapon AND cool asymmetry" — the design lacks focus. The answer should be one thing, stated immediately and confidently, with everything else clearly subordinate. One idea, pushed to obsession. Everything else in service.

If a character could pass as a design from a non-combat game, or could be swapped into a generic anime without looking out of place, the design is not finished. Every character should look like they belong in a world of spectacle — provocative yet tasteful, vivid yet intentional, excessive yet coherent. These are larger-than-life fighters who radiate power, confidence, and allure while feeling unmistakably _alive_. Sensuality with swagger, fashion with teeth, anatomy with attitude, color that celebrates itself, and one obsessive idea that survives all four tests above.

# House Style Design (Revised 2.2)

This visual identity fuses structural exaggeration with electric confidence. Characters are built around bold, high-impact silhouettes that read instantly at a glance and linger in memory long after. Proportions are amplified in _committed_ ways — powerful shoulders, sculpted legs, dramatic collars, elongated limbs, or striking hair shapes — pushed past realism into the territory of visual iconography. Each character carries **one dominant visual absurdity**: a signature element that is logically excessive but emotionally perfect. This could be an oversized accessory, an impossible weapon, a garment worn in a way that defies convention, a piece of anatomy pushed to its expressive limit, or a design "sin" elevated into a statement. This signature element is non-negotiable — it is the thing people remember, cosplay, and draw fan art of. Without it, the character is incomplete. **This signature must be identifiable in isolation** — recognizable even when separated from the full costume, reducible to a single iconic prop, silhouette fragment, or accessory that immediately evokes the character (a blindfold, an anchor, a giant collar, a segmented gauntlet cluster). If the signature only works in context of the full design, it is not strong enough. **A character should not feel like a collection of strong design choices. It should feel like one overwhelming idea executed relentlessly.** The dominant absurdity must clearly overpower all secondary design elements — it is the sun around which everything else orbits. Secondary elements exist to support, frame, and amplify the primary statement, not to compete with it. If multiple elements vie equally for attention, the design lacks hierarchy and focus, and the character will be _interesting_ rather than _iconic_. Interesting is not the goal. Obsessive singularity is.

**The dominant absurdity must carry metaphor, not just mass.** The signature element is not merely the biggest or strangest shape — it is the visible surface of something the character _believes, endures, suppresses, or refuses to let go of_. An oversized anchor is not just a weapon; it is a question — is she bound? A penitent? A relic carrier? A symbol of judgment she drags behind her? A massive collar is not just dramatic geometry; it is a restraint, a ritual garment, a technological limiter, a mark of rank. The exaggeration must suggest a philosophy, restriction, vow, burden, or unresolved emotional state living beneath the surface. This is not about being edgy — it is about being _meaningful_. The symbolic dimension can draw from any well: religious devotion, corporate loyalty, broken oaths, machine hierarchy, memory suppression, self-imposed exile, survivor guilt, artificial life seeking meaning. What matters is that the dominant absurdity rewards a second look. Spectacle alone excites. Symbol endures. **If the signature element cannot be interpreted beyond its visual impact — if it is pure shape with no implied story — the design is unfinished.**

**Silhouette must be extreme, specific, and sculpted.** When reduced to a solid black shape, every character should be instantly distinguishable — not through subtle variation, but through genuinely dramatic difference. **At least one design element must occupy roughly 25–40% of the character's total silhouette mass or visual weight.** This may be a weapon, hair volume, coat tail, collar, shoulder mass, limb exaggeration, or anatomical distortion. If no single element dominates at this scale, the design is underdeveloped. Achieve this extreme silhouette through scale contrast within the design itself: pair something massive with something exposed, something voluminous with something skin-tight, something heavy with something that defies gravity. Asymmetry is a primary tool — one oversized sleeve, one bare arm; armor on one leg, nothing on the other; a cape that only drapes to one side. Symmetry is earned through deliberate choice, not default. **The silhouette itself should imply a direction of travel, not just a shape.** Elements may angle, drag, flare, or arc in ways that suggest force, momentum, or tension — coat tails that imply wind, hair angled permanently as if caught mid-motion, a weapon that pulls posture off-center, straps that hang diagonally, geometry that tilts. The design should feel like it was captured in a moment of kinetic energy. A static, upright, perfectly balanced stance should feel wrong for these characters; even at rest, the silhouette should suggest that movement is about to happen or has just occurred.

**Dominance requires negative space to breathe.** Once the dominant absurdity is established, **remove 30% of the surface detail you think the design needs and ensure at least one major region of uninterrupted negative space.** This is the difference between spectacle and sculpture. A design cluttered edge-to-edge reads as noise; a design with confident emptiness reads as authority. The eye needs a place to rest _against_ the dominant element — bare skin, a sweep of unbroken fabric, a clean geometric plane, an expanse of a single color with no detail competing for attention. **At least one major shape in the design must flow in a continuous arc without hard segmentation** — a long, smooth curve of hair, a single unbroken drape of cloth, an elegant limb line that carries the eye from one region to another without interruption. This curvature is the counterweight to the jagged, aggressive energy of the dominant absurdity. It is what keeps the design from tipping into chaos. The relationship between the dominant element and the negative space around it is what creates _elegance under pressure_ — the design equivalent of a fighter who moves with terrifying grace. Vertical flow and long unbroken lines carry the eye _through_ the design; radial explosions of detail _stop_ the eye. Both are valid tools, but every design needs at least one strong vertical or sweeping arc to prevent the silhouette from reading as a cluster of competing masses rather than a composed figure in motion.

**Anatomy is exaggerated per character, not generically athletic.** Each character's physicality is a statement tuned to their identity. One character may have exaggerated forearms and thick hands that communicate raw power. Another may have impossibly long legs that communicate predatory elegance. Another may be a wall of muscle that borders on architectural. "Fit" is the floor, not the ceiling — the question is always _what specific physical quality is turned up to 11 for this person?_ Visible musculature, pronounced joints, exaggerated v-tapers, sculpted thighs, powerful necks — these are tools of characterization, deployed individually rather than applied uniformly. **Neutral, mid-range builds are prohibited.** Avoid default anime protagonist proportions — the lean, moderately toned, medium-height frame that could belong to anyone. Every character must commit to a physical direction: either amplify mass (heavier musculature, thicker limbs, bulkier structure) or amplify elegance (longer limbs, narrower waist, sharper geometry). A mid-range build is only acceptable if the design's extremity is loaded entirely elsewhere — and even then, something about the body itself should feel _specific_ rather than generic.

**If the character uses a weapon, its scale or form must be visually unconventional.** Oversized, structurally strange, asymmetrical, architecturally stylized, or functionally absurd. Standard sword, katana, and spear silhouettes are not permitted unless heavily modified to the point of near-unrecognizability. A weapon should be as much a character design element as the outfit itself — it participates in the silhouette, contributes to the 25–40% visual weight threshold, and reinforces the character's identity. **A weapon must feel like a relic, an extension of the body, or a philosophical statement** — not equipment selected from an armory. A generic weapon is a missed opportunity and a design failure.

**Outfits are constructed to provoke, not merely to frame.** Clothing should feel like it was designed by someone who understood fashion rules and then strategically broke them. Cropped jackets, high-cut designs, exposed midriffs, open backs, harness elements, and layered fabrics that accentuate muscle and movement — all of these remain core tools. But push further: belts that serve no structural purpose but add visual rhythm and excess. Collars or coattails that are dramatically oversized. Zippers, buckles, and straps that exist for visual density rather than function. Garments worn incorrectly on purpose — a jacket used as a cape, sleeves rolled to different heights, a shirt left strategically undone. Every outfit should have at least one element that a fashion editor would call "too much" — that excess is what makes it a fighting game design rather than a runway look. The fashion sensibility itself should feel _alien and deliberate_ — not superhero spandex, not standard fantasy armor, but something closer to avant-garde runway pieces adapted for violence. Blindfolds in combat. Heeled boots on brawlers. Evening wear cut for a street fight. The strangeness of these choices is a feature, not a contradiction; the design should feel like it emerged from a world with its own internal fashion logic that doesn't answer to ours. Skin exposure is intentional and confident; it communicates self-assurance and dominance, as if the character is fully aware of their physical presence and weaponizes it.

**The emotional register is electric, unrestrained, and alive.** These are characters who enjoy the fight, not endure it. Even brooding or serious archetypes carry a crackling undercurrent of vitality — they may be dangerous, but they are never defeated and never boring. The energy should feel like a dare: confrontational beauty, playful menace, or magnetic arrogance. Characters should look like they _chose_ to look this way — not costumed by circumstance, but self-styled with intention and attitude. The confidence is the point — every design choice, no matter how excessive, reads as deliberate because the character wearing it owns it completely.

**Beneath the confidence, something must ache.** The electric surface is not a mask, but it is not the whole truth either. The most magnetic characters in fighting games carry an undercurrent that the design itself hints at — a tension between what they project and what they carry. This does not mean every character is secretly tragic. It means every character is _layered_. The design should contain at least one element that implies belief, burden, vow, system, ritual, or internal contradiction — something that is not purely aesthetic but suggests a philosophy or restriction beneath the spectacle. A collar that resembles a liturgical vestment. Armor shaped like ceremonial garb rather than military plate. Rosary beads repurposed as knuckle wraps. A garment stitched with repeated symbols. A weapon that looks like it was inherited, not forged. These elements do not need to be explained — they need only to be _felt_. The viewer should sense that the character's design is not arbitrary, that the excess is not random, that the absurdity is rooted in something the character themselves would struggle to articulate. This is the difference between a character you admire and a character you _wonder about_.

**Surface design leans into fashion authority layered with deliberate excess.** Textiles dominate over armor; tailoring, seams, straps, and material contrast add sophistication and edge. But where the fashion world would stop, keep going — add another layer, another strap, another texture break. Hardware and tech elements are integrated as visual punctuation: not overwhelming, but present enough to remind the viewer this is a combatant, not a model. **The design should not feel uniformly polished.** At least one area should introduce deliberate visual friction — density against emptiness, hard mechanical detail against soft fabric, elegant anatomy against brutish hardware, or refined tailoring interrupted by aggressive clutter. A pristine, fashion-editorial smoothness across the entire design signals that it hasn't been pushed far enough. Tension between elements — the feeling that two opposing design philosophies are coexisting within a single character through sheer force of confidence — is what elevates a "good design" into an _unforgettable_ one. **However, friction must be composed, not chaotic.** The tension points should be deliberate contrasts between two or three clear material or shape languages, not an accumulation of unrelated details. The friction is between _ideas_ (soft vs. hard, sacred vs. violent, elegant vs. brutal), not between random visual noise. The tone blends high-fashion runway attitude with arena-ready spectacle — sharp, composed, and unapologetically over-the-top, but always with the sculptural composure of a figure that knows exactly what it is.

**Color is vibrant, graphic, and overwhelming** — never muddy, never muted, never safe, and never dark. Each character follows a disciplined palette anchored by saturation and chroma rather than value contrast. The philosophy is total immersion in color: not a bright accent punching out of shadow, but an entire design that glows from every surface, inescapably vivid, with no darkness to retreat into. The chroma runs hot and celebratory — electric pinks, screaming teals, vivid oranges, deep magentas, lemon yellows, candy violets — deployed in confident graphic blocks rather than gentle gradients. Colors should carry an almost confectionery intensity, the palette of a world where everything is saturated and nothing apologizes for it. **Even the darkest values in a palette must remain chromatic and mid-tone.** Rich plums, deep teals, saturated burgundies, and warm navy can anchor a design, but they must still _read as color_, not as darkness. True black is restricted to linework and tiny structural accents only — it is never a background color, never a dominant garment tone, never a resting place for the eye. If an area of the design reads as "dark" before it reads as a specific hue, the value is too low. The goal is a palette where even the deepest tones feel like they are emitting light rather than absorbing it. Contrast comes from hue shifts and saturation breaks, not from slamming bright against dark. A hot pink next to a saturated teal creates energy through chromatic tension; that same pink against black creates energy through value contrast — and value contrast is not the tool here. The palette should feel like walking into a room where every surface is glowing at full intensity: not a spotlight picking out a subject from shadow, but a world where shadow itself has been replaced by another color. Joyful, loud, and unapologetically everywhere — but never cheap or toy-like, because the underlying hue relationships and saturation discipline are doing real compositional work. Color should feel like an environment, not a declaration — it doesn't announce the character from across an arena so much as it _is_ the arena. The character exists inside their color the way a fish exists inside water.

**The litmus tests.** A design is not finished until it passes all five:

1. **The Silhouette Weight Test.** Reduce the character to a solid black shape. Is there at least one element that commands 25–40% of the total visual mass? Can you identify the character from the silhouette alone — not from subtle cues, but from genuinely dramatic shape difference? Does the silhouette imply direction and energy rather than static balance? If not, the design needs more commitment.
2. **The Uncomfortable Commitment Test.** Look at the design as a whole. Does it feel completely safe, balanced, or reasonable at first glance? If yes, something is missing. At least one element should feel slightly excessive, impractical, or audacious — something that provokes a moment of "that's too much" before resolving into cohesion upon closer inspection. Similarly, the design should contain at least one point of visual friction where competing elements create productive tension. Comfort and uniform polish are the enemies of memorability.
3. **The Isolation Test.** Remove the character's body. Take only the signature element — the weapon, the accessory, the hair, the garment detail. Is it recognizable on its own? Could someone identify the character from this fragment alone? If the signature only works as part of the whole, it is not iconic enough.
4. **The Hierarchy Test.** Look at the design and ask: what is this character _about?_ If the answer is a list — "well, they have a big collar AND long legs AND an interesting weapon AND cool asymmetry" — the design lacks focus. The answer should be one thing, stated immediately and confidently, with everything else clearly subordinate. One idea, pushed to obsession. Everything else in service.
5. **The Human Resonance Test.** Strip away the combat context — the arena, the opponent, the action pose. Look at the character standing alone, in silence. Does at least one element still provoke emotional or symbolic interpretation? Does the design suggest something about what this person _believes, carries, or refuses to release_? If the answer is no — if the design is pure spectacle that only functions inside a fight — it is exciting but hollow. The design must contain at least one element that works as sculpture, not just as performance.

If a character could pass as a design from a non-combat game, or could be swapped into a generic anime without looking out of place, the design is not finished. Every character should look like they belong in a world of spectacle — provocative yet tasteful, vivid yet intentional, excessive yet coherent. These are larger-than-life fighters who radiate power, confidence, and allure while feeling unmistakably _alive_. Sensuality with swagger, fashion with teeth, anatomy with attitude, color that celebrates itself, one obsessive idea that survives all five tests above — and somewhere beneath the electric surface, a quiet weight that makes the whole thing _human_.

# House Style Design (Revised 2.2.1)

This visual identity fuses structural exaggeration with electric confidence. Characters are built around bold, high-impact silhouettes that read instantly at a glance and linger in memory long after. Proportions are amplified in _committed_ ways — powerful shoulders, sculpted legs, dramatic collars, elongated limbs, or striking hair shapes — pushed past realism into the territory of visual iconography. Each character carries **one dominant visual absurdity**: a signature element that is logically excessive but emotionally perfect.

**Anatomy is exaggerated per character, not generically athletic.** Each character's physicality is a statement tuned to their identity.

Another may be a wall of muscle that borders on architectural. "Fit" is the floor, not the ceiling — the question is always _what specific physical quality is turned up to 11 for this person?_ Visible musculature, pronounced joints, exaggerated v-tapers, sculpted thighs, powerful necks — these are tools of characterization, deployed individually rather than applied uniformly. **Neutral, mid-range builds are prohibited.** Avoid default anime protagonist proportions — the lean, moderately toned, medium-height frame that could belong to anyone. Every character must commit to a physical direction: either amplify mass (heavier musculature, thicker limbs, bulkier structure) or amplify elegance (longer limbs, narrower waist, sharper geometry). A mid-range build is only acceptable if the design's extremity is loaded entirely elsewhere — and even then, something about the body itself should feel _specific_ rather than generic.

**If the character uses a weapon, its scale or form must be visually unconventional.** Oversized, structurally strange, asymmetrical, architecturally stylized, or functionally absurd. Standard sword, katana, and spear silhouettes are not permitted unless heavily modified to the point of near-unrecognizability. A weapon should be as much a character design element as the outfit itself — it participates in the silhouette, contributes to the 25–40% visual weight threshold, and reinforces the character's identity. **A weapon must feel like a relic, an extension of the body, or a philosophical statement** — not equipment selected from an armory. A generic weapon is a missed opportunity and a design failure.

**Outfits are constructed to provoke, not merely to frame.** Clothing should feel like it was designed by someone who understood fashion rules and then strategically broke them. Cropped jackets, high-cut designs, exposed midriffs, open backs, harness elements, and layered fabrics that accentuate muscle and movement — all of these remain core tools. But push further: belts that serve no structural purpose but add visual rhythm and excess. Collars or coattails that are dramatically oversized. Zippers, buckles, and straps that exist for visual density rather than function. Garments worn incorrectly on purpose — a jacket used as a cape, sleeves rolled to different heights, a shirt left strategically undone. Every outfit should have at least one element that a fashion editor would call "too much" — that excess is what makes it a fighting game design rather than a runway look. The fashion sensibility itself should feel _alien and deliberate_ — not superhero spandex, not standard fantasy armor, but something closer to avant-garde runway pieces adapted for violence. Blindfolds in combat. Heeled boots on brawlers. Evening wear cut for a street fight. The strangeness of these choices is a feature, not a contradiction; the design should feel like it emerged from a world with its own internal fashion logic that doesn't answer to ours. Skin exposure is intentional and confident; it communicates self-assurance and dominance, as if the character is fully aware of their physical presence and weaponizes it.

**The emotional register is electric, unrestrained, and alive.** These are characters who enjoy the fight, not endure it. Even brooding or serious archetypes carry a crackling undercurrent of vitality — they may be dangerous, but they are never defeated and never boring. The energy should feel like a dare: confrontational beauty, playful menace, or magnetic arrogance. Characters should look like they _chose_ to look this way — not costumed by circumstance, but self-styled with intention and attitude. The confidence is the point — every design choice, no matter how excessive, reads as deliberate because the character wearing it owns it completely.

**Beneath the confidence, something must ache.** The electric surface is not a mask, but it is not the whole truth either. The most magnetic characters in fighting games carry an undercurrent that the design itself hints at — a tension between what they project and what they carry. This does not mean every character is secretly tragic. It means every character is _layered_. The design should contain at least one element that implies belief, burden, vow, system, ritual, or internal contradiction — something that is not purely aesthetic but suggests a philosophy or restriction beneath the spectacle. A collar that resembles a liturgical vestment. Armor shaped like ceremonial garb rather than military plate. Rosary beads repurposed as knuckle wraps. A garment stitched with repeated symbols. A weapon that looks like it was inherited, not forged. These elements do not need to be explained — they need only to be _felt_. The viewer should sense that the character's design is not arbitrary, that the excess is not random, that the absurdity is rooted in something the character themselves would struggle to articulate. This is the difference between a character you admire and a character you _wonder about_.

**Surface design leans into fashion authority layered with deliberate excess.** Textiles dominate over armor; tailoring, seams, straps, and material contrast add sophistication and edge. But where the fashion world would stop, keep going — add another layer, another strap, another texture break. Hardware and tech elements are integrated as visual punctuation: not overwhelming, but present enough to remind the viewer this is a combatant, not a model. **The design should not feel uniformly polished.** At least one area should introduce deliberate visual friction — density against emptiness, hard mechanical detail against soft fabric, elegant anatomy against brutish hardware, or refined tailoring interrupted by aggressive clutter. A pristine, fashion-editorial smoothness across the entire design signals that it hasn't been pushed far enough. Tension between elements — the feeling that two opposing design philosophies are coexisting within a single character through sheer force of confidence — is what elevates a "good design" into an _unforgettable_ one. **However, friction must be composed, not chaotic.** The tension points should be deliberate contrasts between two or three clear material or shape languages, not an accumulation of unrelated details. The friction is between _ideas_ (soft vs. hard, sacred vs. violent, elegant vs. brutal), not between random visual noise. The tone blends high-fashion runway attitude with arena-ready spectacle — sharp, composed, and unapologetically over-the-top, but always with the sculptural composure of a figure that knows exactly what it is.

**Color is vibrant, graphic, and overwhelming** — never muddy, never muted, never safe, and never dark _by default_. Each character follows a disciplined palette anchored by saturation and chroma rather than value contrast. The philosophy is total immersion in color: not a bright accent punching out of shadow, but an entire design that glows from every surface, inescapably vivid, with no darkness to hide in by habit. The chroma runs hot and celebratory — electric pinks, screaming teals, vivid oranges, deep magentas, lemon yellows, candy violets — deployed in confident graphic blocks rather than gentle gradients. Colors should carry an almost confectionery intensity, the palette of a world where everything is saturated and nothing apologizes for it. **Even the darkest values in a palette must remain chromatic.** Rich plums, deep teals, saturated burgundies, and warm navy can anchor a design, but they must still _read as color_, not as generic shadow. True black is restricted to linework and tiny structural accents only — it is never a background color, never a dominant garment tone, never a default. If an area of the design reads as "dark" before it reads as a specific hue, the value is too low — unless that darkness is _ceremonial_. **Darkness in this system is not absent; it is deliberate.** Visual gravity must come from hue density, composure, or symbolic restraint — not from generic shadow or grimdark habit. A deep, saturated plum used to weight a sacred garment detail is doing real work; the same value used as a lazy base tone for an entire coat is not. Darkness earns its place the same way silence earns its place in music: through contrast with everything surrounding it, deployed with intent, never as default. The goal is a palette where even the deepest tones feel like they are holding something rather than absorbing it. Contrast comes from hue shifts and saturation breaks, not from slamming bright against dark. A hot pink next to a saturated teal creates energy through chromatic tension; that same pink against black creates energy through value contrast — and value contrast is not the primary tool here. The palette should feel like walking into a room where every surface is glowing at full intensity: not a spotlight picking out a subject from shadow, but a world where shadow itself has been replaced by another color — except in the rare, reverent places where a pocket of visual gravity anchors the design and gives the eye permission to be still. Joyful, loud, and unapologetically everywhere — but never cheap or toy-like, because the underlying hue relationships and saturation discipline are doing real compositional work. Color should feel like an environment, not a declaration — it doesn't announce the character from across an arena so much as it _is_ the arena. The character exists inside their color the way a fish exists inside water.

**The litmus tests.** A design is not finished until it passes all five:

1. **The Silhouette Weight Test.** Reduce the character to a solid black shape. Is there at least one element that commands 25–40% of the total visual mass? Can you identify the character from the silhouette alone — not from subtle cues, but from genuinely dramatic shape difference? Does the silhouette imply direction and energy rather than static balance? If not, the design needs more commitment.
2. **The Uncomfortable Commitment Test.** Look at the design as a whole. Does it feel completely safe, balanced, or reasonable at first glance? If yes, something is missing. At least one element should feel slightly excessive, impractical, or audacious — something that provokes a moment of "that's too much" before resolving into cohesion upon closer inspection. Similarly, the design should contain at least one point of visual friction where competing elements create productive tension. Comfort and uniform polish are the enemies of memorability.
3. **The Isolation Test.** Remove the character's body. Take only the signature element — the weapon, the accessory, the hair, the garment detail. Is it recognizable on its own? Could someone identify the character from this fragment alone? If the signature only works as part of the whole, it is not iconic enough.
4. **The Hierarchy Test.** Look at the design and ask: what is this character _about?_ If the answer is a list — "well, they have a big collar AND long legs AND an interesting weapon AND cool asymmetry" — the design lacks focus. The answer should be one thing, stated immediately and confidently, with everything else clearly subordinate. One idea, pushed to obsession. Everything else in service.
5. **The Human Resonance Test.** Strip away the combat context — the arena, the opponent, the action pose. Look at the character standing alone, in silence. Does at least one element still provoke emotional or symbolic interpretation? Does the design suggest something about what this person _believes, carries, or refuses to release_? If the answer is no — if the design is pure spectacle that only functions inside a fight — it is exciting but hollow. The design must contain at least one element that works as sculpture, not just as performance.

If a character could pass as a design from a non-combat game, or could be swapped into a generic anime without looking out of place, the design is not finished. Every character should look like they belong in a world of spectacle — provocative yet tasteful, vivid yet intentional, excessive yet coherent. These are larger-than-life fighters who radiate power, confidence, and allure while feeling unmistakably _alive_. Sensuality with swagger, fashion with teeth, anatomy with attitude, color that celebrates itself, one obsessive idea that survives all five tests above — and somewhere beneath the electric surface, a quiet weight that makes the whole thing _human_.

# House Style Design (Revised 3.0)

This visual identity fuses structural exaggeration with electric confidence. Characters are built around bold, high-impact silhouettes that read instantly at a glance and linger in memory long after. Proportions are amplified in _committed_ ways — powerful shoulders, sculpted legs, dramatic collars, elongated limbs, or striking hair shapes — pushed past realism into the territory of visual iconography. Each character carries **one dominant visual absurdity**: a signature element that is logically excessive but emotionally perfect. This could be an oversized accessory, an impossible weapon, a garment worn in a way that defies convention, a piece of anatomy pushed to its expressive limit, or a design "sin" elevated into a statement. This signature element is non-negotiable — it is the thing people remember, cosplay, and draw fan art of. Without it, the character is incomplete. **This signature must be identifiable in isolation** — recognizable even when separated from the full costume, reducible to a single iconic prop, silhouette fragment, or accessory that immediately evokes the character (a blindfold, an anchor, a giant collar, a segmented gauntlet cluster). If the signature only works in context of the full design, it is not strong enough. **A character should not feel like a collection of strong design choices. It should feel like one overwhelming idea executed relentlessly.** The dominant absurdity must clearly overpower all secondary design elements — it is the sun around which everything else orbits. Secondary elements exist to support, frame, and amplify the primary statement, not to compete with it. If multiple elements vie equally for attention, the design lacks hierarchy and focus, and the character will be _interesting_ rather than _iconic_. Interesting is not the goal. Obsessive singularity is.

**The dominant absurdity must carry metaphor, not just mass.** The signature element is not merely the biggest or strangest shape — it is the visible surface of something the character _believes, endures, suppresses, or refuses to let go of_. An oversized anchor is not just a weapon; it is a question — is she bound? A penitent? A relic carrier? A symbol of judgment she drags behind her? A massive collar is not just dramatic geometry; it is a restraint, a ritual garment, a technological limiter, a mark of rank. The exaggeration must suggest a philosophy, restriction, vow, burden, or unresolved emotional state living beneath the surface. This is not about being edgy — it is about being _meaningful_. The symbolic dimension can draw from any well: religious devotion, corporate loyalty, broken oaths, machine hierarchy, memory suppression, self-imposed exile, survivor guilt, artificial life seeking meaning. What matters is that the dominant absurdity rewards a second look. Spectacle alone excites. Symbol endures. **If the signature element cannot be interpreted beyond its visual impact — if it is pure shape with no implied story — the design is unfinished.**

**Silhouette must be extreme, specific, and sculpted.** When reduced to a solid black shape, every character should be instantly distinguishable — not through subtle variation, but through genuinely dramatic difference. **At least one design element must occupy roughly 25–40% of the character's total silhouette mass or visual weight.** This may be a weapon, hair volume, coat tail, collar, shoulder mass, limb exaggeration, or anatomical distortion. If no single element dominates at this scale, the design is underdeveloped. Achieve this extreme silhouette through scale contrast within the design itself: pair something massive with something exposed, something voluminous with something skin-tight, something heavy with something that defies gravity. Asymmetry is a primary tool — one oversized sleeve, one bare arm; armor on one leg, nothing on the other; a cape that only drapes to one side. Symmetry is earned through deliberate choice, not default. **The silhouette itself should imply a direction of travel, not just a shape.** Elements may angle, drag, flare, or arc in ways that suggest force, momentum, or tension — coat tails that imply wind, hair angled permanently as if caught mid-motion, a weapon that pulls posture off-center, straps that hang diagonally, geometry that tilts. The design should feel like it was captured in a moment of kinetic energy. A static, upright, perfectly balanced stance should feel wrong for these characters; even at rest, the silhouette should suggest that movement is about to happen or has just occurred.

**Dominance requires negative space to breathe.** Once the dominant absurdity is established, **remove 30% of the surface detail you think the design needs and ensure at least one major region of uninterrupted negative space.** This is the difference between spectacle and sculpture. A design cluttered edge-to-edge reads as noise; a design with confident emptiness reads as authority. The eye needs a place to rest _against_ the dominant element — bare skin, a sweep of unbroken fabric, a clean geometric plane, an expanse of a single color with no detail competing for attention. **At least one major shape in the design must flow in a continuous arc without hard segmentation** — a long, smooth curve of hair, a single unbroken drape of cloth, an elegant limb line that carries the eye from one region to another without interruption. This curvature is the counterweight to the jagged, aggressive energy of the dominant absurdity. It is what keeps the design from tipping into chaos. The relationship between the dominant element and the negative space around it is what creates _elegance under pressure_ — the design equivalent of a fighter who moves with terrifying grace. Vertical flow and long unbroken lines carry the eye _through_ the design; radial explosions of detail _stop_ the eye. Both are valid tools, but every design needs at least one strong vertical or sweeping arc to prevent the silhouette from reading as a cluster of competing masses rather than a composed figure in motion.

**Anatomy is exaggerated per character, not generically athletic.** Each character's physicality is a statement tuned to their identity. One character may have exaggerated forearms and thick hands that communicate raw power. Another may have impossibly long legs that communicate predatory elegance. Another may be a wall of muscle that borders on architectural. "Fit" is the floor, not the ceiling — the question is always _what specific physical quality is turned up to 11 for this person?_ Visible musculature, pronounced joints, exaggerated v-tapers, sculpted thighs, powerful necks — these are tools of characterization, deployed individually rather than applied uniformly. **Neutral, mid-range builds are prohibited.** Avoid default anime protagonist proportions — the lean, moderately toned, medium-height frame that could belong to anyone. Every character must commit to a physical direction: either amplify mass (heavier musculature, thicker limbs, bulkier structure) or amplify elegance (longer limbs, narrower waist, sharper geometry). A mid-range build is only acceptable if the design's extremity is loaded entirely elsewhere — and even then, something about the body itself should feel _specific_ rather than generic.

**If the character uses a weapon, its scale or form must be visually unconventional.** Oversized, structurally strange, asymmetrical, architecturally stylized, or functionally absurd. Standard sword, katana, and spear silhouettes are not permitted unless heavily modified to the point of near-unrecognizability. A weapon should be as much a character design element as the outfit itself — it participates in the silhouette, contributes to the 25–40% visual weight threshold, and reinforces the character's identity. **A weapon must feel like a relic, an extension of the body, or a philosophical statement** — not equipment selected from an armory. A generic weapon is a missed opportunity and a design failure.

**Outfits are constructed with fashion intelligence, then broken with fighting-game intent.** Clothing should feel like it was _designed_ — not assembled from costume parts but tailored by someone who understands fabric, cut, silhouette, and the way a garment communicates status, vulnerability, and intent. The foundation is high fashion: real textiles, visible seam structure, tailoring that implies a world with its own fashion industry and its own aesthetic values. Cropped jackets, high-cut designs, exposed midriffs, open backs, harness elements, and layered fabrics that accentuate muscle and movement remain core tools — but deployed with the confidence of someone who knows exactly which rules they are breaking and why. Every garment should feel like it reveals something about the _person wearing it_, not just the fighter — sensuality expressed through cut and confidence rather than through exposure alone. The intimacy is the point: these outfits suggest that the character chose them in a private moment, with full awareness of what they communicate. **Then push it.** The fashion foundation provides sophistication; the fighting-game layer provides excess. One element per outfit should cross from runway into arena — a collar that's dramatically oversized, buckles that are purely sculptural, a coattail that defies physics. Garments worn incorrectly on purpose — a jacket used as a cape, sleeves at different heights, a shirt left strategically undone. The fashion sensibility itself should feel _alien and deliberate_ — not superhero spandex, not standard fantasy armor, but something closer to avant-garde pieces adapted for violence. Blindfolds in combat. Heeled boots on brawlers. Evening wear cut for a street fight. The strangeness of these choices is a feature, not a contradiction; the design should feel like it emerged from a world with its own internal fashion logic that doesn't answer to ours. **But the excess must be _edited_, not accumulated.** Where a lesser design adds more straps, more buckles, more layers to fill empty space, this style adds one devastating element and lets the tailoring do the rest. The measure of a successful outfit is not how much is on the character, but how much was _removed_ and the design still works — with the remaining excess hitting harder for its isolation.

**The emotional register is electric, unrestrained, and alive.** These are characters who enjoy the fight, not endure it. Even brooding or serious archetypes carry a crackling undercurrent of vitality — they may be dangerous, but they are never defeated and never boring. The energy should feel like a dare: confrontational beauty, playful menace, or magnetic arrogance. Characters should look like they _chose_ to look this way — not costumed by circumstance, but self-styled with intention and attitude. The confidence is the point — every design choice, no matter how excessive, reads as deliberate because the character wearing it owns it completely.

**Beneath the confidence, something must ache.** The electric surface is not a mask, but it is not the whole truth either. The most magnetic characters in fighting games carry an undercurrent that the design itself hints at — a tension between what they project and what they carry. This does not mean every character is secretly tragic. It means every character is _layered_. The design should contain at least one element that implies belief, burden, vow, system, ritual, or internal contradiction — something that is not purely aesthetic but suggests a philosophy or restriction beneath the spectacle. A collar that resembles a liturgical vestment. Armor shaped like ceremonial garb rather than military plate. Rosary beads repurposed as knuckle wraps. A garment stitched with repeated symbols. A weapon that looks like it was inherited, not forged. These elements do not need to be explained — they need only to be _felt_. The viewer should sense that the character's design is not arbitrary, that the excess is not random, that the absurdity is rooted in something the character themselves would struggle to articulate. This is the difference between a character you admire and a character you _wonder about_.

**Surface design balances fashion sophistication with deliberate friction.** Textiles dominate over armor; tailoring, seams, straps, and material contrast add sophistication and edge. Hardware and tech elements are integrated as visual punctuation: not overwhelming, but present enough to remind the viewer this is a combatant, not a model. **The design should not feel uniformly polished, but friction must be _composed_, not chaotic.** At least one area should introduce deliberate visual tension — density against emptiness, hard mechanical detail against soft fabric, elegant anatomy against brutish hardware, or refined tailoring interrupted by one aggressive element. But this tension is between _ideas_ (soft vs. hard, sacred vs. violent, elegant vs. brutal), not between accumulated random details. A pristine, fashion-editorial smoothness across the entire design signals that it hasn't been pushed far enough into fighting-game territory. But clutter across the entire design signals that the fashion intelligence has been abandoned. The sweet spot is a design that looks like it was styled by someone with impeccable taste who then, deliberately and with full awareness, added one thing that shouldn't be there — and that wrong thing is what makes it unforgettable.

**Color is luminous, saturated, and celebratory** — never muddy, never muted, never safe, and never dark by default. Each character follows a disciplined palette anchored by high chroma and full saturation, but unlike flat graphic color, these palettes have _depth_. Color doesn't just sit on the character — it _radiates from_ them. The philosophy is magical-girl confidence applied to combat design: every surface glows with material awareness, highlights bloom with intention, and the palette feels like it exists in a world where light itself is more generous than ours. The chroma runs hot and joyful — electric pinks, screaming teals, vivid oranges, deep magentas, lemon yellows, candy violets — but rendered with enough internal structure that fabrics feel like fabrics, skin feels warm, metal catches light, and hair has sheen. This is not flat posterization; it is _saturated realism's more confident sibling_.

**Shading is structured, cel-edged, and hue-shifted.** Shadow and highlight are not value adjustments (darker/lighter versions of the same hue) but _chromatic shifts_ — a plum garment's shadow shifts toward burgundy, not toward black; a teal accent's highlight shifts toward cyan, not toward white. Transitions between light and shadow are hard-edged and decisive, like the best cel-shaded game rendering (Arc System Works is the gold standard here). The result reads as graphic and bold from across a room but reveals material sophistication up close. Soft airbrushed gradients, ambient occlusion darkening, and realistic light simulation are prohibited — the shading model is _stylized and intentional_, never automated.

**Even the darkest values in a palette must remain chromatic.** Rich plums, deep teals, saturated burgundies, and warm navy can anchor a design, but they must still _read as color_, not as generic shadow. True black is restricted to linework and tiny structural accents only — it is never a background color, never a dominant garment tone, never a default. If an area of the design reads as "dark" before it reads as a specific hue, the value is too low — unless that darkness is _ceremonial_. **Darkness in this system is not absent; it is deliberate.** Visual gravity must come from hue density, composure, or symbolic restraint — not from generic shadow or grimdark habit. A deep, saturated plum used to weight a sacred garment detail is doing real work; the same value used as a lazy base tone for an entire coat is not. Darkness earns its place the same way silence earns its place in music: through contrast with everything surrounding it, deployed with intent, never as default.

**Color is identity at a glance.** Despite the rendering depth, every character must be reducible to a two- or three-color identity that reads instantly at thumbnail scale. This is the Overwatch principle: if you squint, the character becomes a color silhouette that is distinct from every other character on the roster. The palette discipline means that no two characters share a dominant hue, and each character's color identity is recognizable even in motion, at distance, or partially obscured. The internal rendering richness exists _within_ this graphic identity framework, not instead of it. A character can have luminous material rendering on every surface and still read as "the teal one" from fifty feet away. **Color should feel like an environment the character inhabits** — not a spotlight picking them out of shadow, but a world where light is abundant, saturated, and celebratory. The character exists inside their color the way a fish exists inside water — except in the rare, reverent places where a pocket of visual gravity anchors the design and gives the eye permission to be still.

**The litmus tests.** A design is not finished until it passes all five:

1. **The Silhouette Weight Test.** Reduce the character to a solid black shape. Is there at least one element that commands 25–40% of the total visual mass? Can you identify the character from the silhouette alone — not from subtle cues, but from genuinely dramatic shape difference? Does the silhouette imply direction and energy rather than static balance? If not, the design needs more commitment.
2. **The Uncomfortable Commitment Test.** Look at the design as a whole. Does it feel completely safe, balanced, or reasonable at first glance? If yes, something is missing. At least one element should feel slightly excessive, impractical, or audacious — something that provokes a moment of "that's too much" before resolving into cohesion upon closer inspection. Similarly, the design should contain at least one point of visual friction where competing elements create productive tension. Comfort and uniform polish are the enemies of memorability.
3. **The Isolation Test.** Remove the character's body. Take only the signature element — the weapon, the accessory, the hair, the garment detail. Is it recognizable on its own? Could someone identify the character from this fragment alone? If the signature only works as part of the whole, it is not iconic enough.
4. **The Hierarchy Test.** Look at the design and ask: what is this character _about?_ If the answer is a list — "well, they have a big collar AND long legs AND an interesting weapon AND cool asymmetry" — the design lacks focus. The answer should be one thing, stated immediately and confidently, with everything else clearly subordinate. One idea, pushed to obsession. Everything else in service.

If the answer is no — if the design is pure spectacle that only functions inside a fight — it is exciting but hollow. The design must contain at least one element that works as sculpture, not just as performance.

If a character could pass as a design from a non-combat game, or could be swapped into a generic anime without looking out of place, the design is not finished. Every character should look like they belong in a world of spectacle — provocative yet tasteful, vivid yet intentional, excessive yet coherent. The visual identity lives at the intersection of four commitments: the luminous, celebratory color of magical-girl confidence; the intimate, intelligent fashion of high-end editorial adapted for violence; the kinetic, over-the-top character energy of arena fighters; and the instant, graphic readability of the best competitive game design. These are larger-than-life fighters who radiate power, confidence, and allure while feeling unmistakably _alive_. Fashion with teeth, anatomy with attitude, color that celebrates itself, one obsessive idea that survives all five tests above — and somewhere beneath the electric surface, a quiet weight that makes the whole thing _human_.

# House Style → Image Prompt Compiler (v2.0)

## Purpose

This document is a **translation layer** between the House Style Design document (v2.2.1) and any LLM tasked with generating text-to-image prompts from it. The house style defines _what_ a character should be. This document defines _how to talk to an image model_ so the output actually looks like it.

Read the house style first. Then read this. Then generate prompts.

---

## Core Problem

Image models have strong aesthetic priors. Their training data is saturated with clean anime concept art, ArtStation character sheets, and industry-standard turnarounds. Any prompt that uses familiar language — "stylized cel-shaded concept art," "fighting game character," "athletic female" — will slide into these attractors and produce competent, normalized, generic output. The house style demands characters that combine magical-girl luminous color, NieR-level fashion intelligence, Guilty Gear's kinetic excess, and Overwatch's graphic readability — a combination that does not exist as a single category in any model's training data. The prompt must force this intersection into existence.

---

## Prompt Architecture

Every prompt must follow this structure, in this order. The model reads front-to-back with decaying attention. Put style and distortion first; put avoidance last.

### 1. STYLE COLLISION (first 20 tokens)

Open with an _unusual intersection of two aesthetics_ that the model doesn't normally combine. This forces it off its default rendering path before it commits to a composition.

**Never use:** "concept art," "character sheet," "character design," "anime style," "game art"

These are the five strongest generic attractors in any model's vocabulary. They override everything that follows.

**Instead, collide aesthetics from the FOUR PILLARS (luminous color + fashion intelligence + kinetic excess + graphic readability):**

- "Guilty Gear Xrd character rendering with magical-girl color saturation and NieR Automata's fashion sensibility — competitive fighting game energy"
- "Arc System Works cel-shaded game art with Precure's luminous color palette and high-fashion editorial tailoring"
- "Overwatch's graphic readability meets Guilty Gear's kinetic excess — rendered with saturated, glowing, magical-girl color confidence"
- "NieR Automata's fashion intelligence applied to an over-the-top competitive fighter, colored like a magical girl transformation sequence"
- "Vanillaware's rendering richness meets Overwatch's silhouette clarity — haute couture combat design in celebratory, luminous color"

The collision should anchor in _game art_ rendering (Arc System Works, Vanillaware) while pulling color toward _magical-girl saturation_ and fashion toward _editorial intelligence_. The readability constraint keeps it from becoming painterly mush.

**Always append:** "NOT concept art. NOT character sheet. NOT character turnaround. NOT Western comic book. NOT American cartoon. NOT dark/gloomy."

### 2. PROPORTION DISTORTION (explicit ratios)

Image models parse fitness adjectives ("athletic," "muscular," "powerful build") as minor variations on their default body type. To get the house style's committed anatomical exaggeration, use **figure-drawing measurement language** that the model learned from art tutorials in its training data.

**Never use:** "athletic build," "muscular," "powerful," "sculpted," "toned," "fit"

**Instead, use head-unit ratios and comparative scale language:**

- "Shoulder width is 4 head-widths across" (forces exaggerated breadth)
- "Legs are 5.5 heads long" (forces elongation past realism)
- "Forearms are as thick as the head is wide" (forces mass commitment)
- "Waist circumference is less than one head-width" (forces dramatic taper)
- "Hands are 1.5x realistic scale" (forces specific enlargement)

**Use adversarial metaphor to push past "fit person":**

- "This is not a fit person — this is a body _designed like furniture_"
- "Anatomy exaggerated to the point of architectural caricature"
- "Proportions are a committed lie — not stylized-normal but genuinely distorted"
- "The body is a _statement_, not a physique"

The goal is to make the model uncomfortable enough to leave the "well-proportioned anime character" basin without falling into grotesque or comedic territory.

### 3. DOMINANT ABSURDITY (scale + spatial relationship)

The house style's 25–40% silhouette mass rule does not translate into image model language as a percentage. Models cannot calculate visual mass. Instead, give the model **concrete scale comparisons** and **spatial relationships to the body**.

**Never use:** "occupying ~35% of the silhouette mass"

**Instead, use body-relative scale:**

- "The collar ring is WIDER than the shoulders and TALLER than the head"
- "The weapon extends from knee to two feet above the head"
- "The cape, when fully extended, is longer than the character is tall"
- "The gauntlet cluster is larger than the character's entire torso"
- "The ribbon trails are each three times the character's arm length"

**Establish hierarchy through explicit dominance language:**

- "This element is the character. Everything else is subordinate."
- "The [element] should command more visual attention than the face."
- "If you removed the [element], the remaining design would feel incomplete — a supporting cast without its lead."

**Name the symbolic weight directly:**

- "The collar reads as a self-imposed restraint — ceremonial, not decorative"
- "The weapon looks inherited, not forged — a relic carried as obligation"
- "The blindfold implies suppression, not disability — chosen silence"

Models don't interpret symbolism, but symbolic descriptors pull from different training data (religious art, editorial fashion, fine art photography) than pure design descriptors, which nudges rendering toward more unusual territory.

### 4. OUTFIT AS FASHION INTELLIGENCE (material + behavior + intimacy)

"Cropped jacket" and "asymmetrical bodysuit" are garment _names_. The model will render its default version of these items. To get the house style's fashion-as-character-revelation, describe **what the fabric is doing**, **how it relates to the body**, and **what it communicates about the person wearing it**.

**Never use garment names alone.** Always pair with material behavior and human intent:

- NOT: "cropped jacket worn as half-cape"
    
- YES: "a stiff, tailored jacket — sharp lapels, visible seam structure, fabric that implies expensive manufacturing — draped over only the right shoulder as a deliberate styling choice, left arm completely bare; the asymmetry feels chosen, not accidental"
    
- NOT: "high-cut asymmetrical bodysuit with harness straps"
    
- YES: "a single-piece garment cut high on the left hip exposing the entire thigh, low on the right side; the fabric is smooth matte with visible tension where it meets skin; three industrial buckles sit along the ribs — the only hardware on an otherwise clean, tailored silhouette — oversized and sculptural, clearly non-functional"
    

**Describe the fashion as intelligent, then broken:**

- "The outfit reads as high-fashion editorial — sophisticated, considered, intimate — with ONE element that crosses into arena spectacle: [specific element]"
- "Every garment looks tailored and intentional, as if the character dressed with full awareness of what they're communicating. The [specific element] is the deliberate violation."
- "The outfit suggests a world with its own fashion industry. This character is well-dressed by that world's standards — except for [specific element], which is excessive by any world's standards."

**Describe intimacy and human intent:**

- "The shirt is unbuttoned to the sternum — this reads as a _choice_, not an accident. The collar is still sharp. The cuffs are still buttoned."
- "Skin exposure is confident, not gratuitous — the bare back and shoulders suggest someone who chose vulnerability as a statement of power"
- "The outfit reveals something about the person wearing it, not just the fighter — there is a private logic to why these specific garments, in this specific combination"

### 5. NEGATIVE SPACE AS COMPOSITION COMMAND

Models default to filling the character with detail. The house style requires deliberate emptiness. This must be phrased as a **spatial directive** — telling the model exactly _where_ to leave nothing.

**Use anatomical landmarks as boundaries:**

- "The entire region from left hip to mid-thigh must be a SINGLE unbroken color — no straps, no buckles, no texture, no detail"
- "The upper back between the shoulder blades is completely exposed skin with no overlapping elements"
- "One arm is entirely bare from shoulder to wrist — no gloves, no wraps, no accessories of any kind"

**Name the arc explicitly:**

- "One continuous sweeping curve runs from the top of the collar down through the cape's edge to the floor — this line must not be interrupted by any crossing element"
- "The hair forms a single smooth S-curve from crown to the tips — no stray strands, no segmentation, no hard breaks in the flow"

**Contrast the emptiness against the density:**

- "The right side of the body is cluttered with hardware and straps; the left side is clean fabric and bare skin. This asymmetry is the composition."

### 6. COLOR AS ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT

The house style's chromatic philosophy is the most unusual element and the one models will fight hardest. Standard prompts say "color palette: X, Y, Z" and the model uses them as _suggestions_. You need to make them _non-negotiable_.

**Lock the palette with enforcement language, but permit luminous rendering:**

- "EXACTLY four base colors. Not approximately. Not 'inspired by.' EXACTLY these four as the foundation, with shading and highlights derived as hue-shifts within this color family."
- "Deep saturated plum. Warm porcelain. Electric teal. Acid yellow. These are the ONLY base hues. All shading and highlighting are chromatic shifts within this family."

**Specify the LUMINOUS rendering model:**

- "Colors should GLOW — every surface has material awareness. Fabric has sheen, skin is warm, metal catches light, hair has luminous highlights. This is not flat posterization; it is saturated rendering with celebratory, magical-girl color confidence."
- "Shading is hard-edged cel-shading with HUE-SHIFTED shadow tones: plum shadows shift toward burgundy, teal shadows shift toward deep ocean blue. Highlights bloom toward warmer or brighter hues, not toward white."
- "The overall color impression should feel LUMINOUS and CELEBRATORY — like a magical girl transformation sequence applied to a serious competitive fighter. Every surface radiates color rather than absorbing it."
- "Think Arc System Works rendering precision (hard cel-edges, structured shading) combined with Precure/magical-girl color saturation and glow."

**Ban specific rendering failures:**

- "NO soft airbrushed shading. NO smooth gradient falloff. NO realistic ambient occlusion. NO desaturation in shadows."
- "NO dark, gloomy, or noir color treatment. NO earth tones. NO muted palette. Shadows remain SATURATED and CHROMATIC."
- "If any shading darkens a color toward grey or black rather than shifting it toward another saturated hue, the image has failed."

**Handle the ceremonial gravity permission:**

- "One small region — no larger than 10% of the total design — may use the darkest palette color at higher density to create visual weight. This darkness is deliberate and ceremonial. It anchors the design. It is not shadow."

**Ban black explicitly and repeatedly:**

- "True black (#000000) appears ONLY as thin linework edges. Never as fill. Never as shading. Never as background. Never as a garment color."

### 7. RENDERING DIRECTIVES (anti-default)

Standard rendering keywords trigger the model's most normalized outputs. Replace them with _adversarial rendering language_ that forces unusual treatment.

**Never use:** "cel-shaded," "clean linework," "studio lighting," "3/4 view"

**Instead, specify the rendering model positively and negatively:**

- "Luminous cel-shading with hard edges and material awareness — fabric has sheen, skin glows warm, metal reflects. NOT soft airbrushed, NOT Western comic flat fills, NOT realistic 3D rendering, NOT matte posterization"
- "Visible linework with weight variation — NOT uniform vector strokes, NOT thick Western comic outlines"
- "Colors are saturated and celebratory across the ENTIRE design — no region of the character should feel desaturated, grey, muddy, or dark. Even shadows glow with chromatic intensity"
- "Hard directional light from upper-left with luminous fill — the lighting is graphic but generous, not cinematic and not harsh. The character should look like they exist in a world where light is abundant and colorful"
- "The rendering should feel like high-quality Japanese game art — closer to Arc System Works or Vanillaware than to Marvel Comics, closer to Precure's color confidence than to NieR's muted palette"

**Specify the output format adversarially:**

- "This is a single character on a flat neutral background. It is NOT a scene. There is no environment. There is no ground shadow. There is no atmospheric perspective."
- "The character is presented as a portrait — one figure, one pose, one composition. NOT a character sheet. NOT a turnaround. NOT multiple views."

### 8. HARD AVOID LIST (aggressive + specific)

The avoid list is your last line of defense. Make it long, specific, and targeted at the model's most persistent defaults.

**Always include these categorical bans:**

```
AVOID: photorealism, semi-realism, painterly rendering, soft gradients,
atmospheric fog, volumetric lighting, cinematic color grading, depth of field,
bokeh, motion blur, lens flare, film grain.

AVOID: Western comic book art, American cartoon style, pop art, vector
illustration, graphic novel rendering, thick uniform outlines, Bruce Timm
style, Marvel/DC house style, flat posterized coloring.

AVOID: concept art layout, character turnaround sheet, T-pose, A-pose,
model sheet, orthographic views, multiple angles, reference sheet.

AVOID: default anime proportions, generic athletic build, standard
anime face, same-face syndrome, moe proportions, chibi elements.

AVOID: muted colors, desaturated palette, earth tones, grey tones, brown
tones, dark backgrounds, black backgrounds, dramatic shadow, noir lighting,
grimdark atmosphere, gloomy mood, NieR-style muted coloring, dark fantasy
palette, washed-out colors, greyed-out shadows.

AVOID: multiple characters, text, logos, watermarks, signatures, UI elements,
speech bubbles, panel borders, extra props not described above.
```

**Add character-specific bans for elements that would undermine the dominant absurdity:**

- If the dominant element is a collar: "AVOID: necklaces, chokers, scarves, or any neck accessory that is not the described collar ring"
- If the dominant element is a weapon: "AVOID: any weapon in the character's OTHER hand, any holstered secondary weapon, any weapon not described above"
- If the dominant element is a cape: "AVOID: symmetrical capes, superhero capes, short cloaks, any cape that does not match the described shape and asymmetry"

## Example: Halo Warden (recompiled for v3.0)

```
Guilty Gear Xrd character rendering with magical-girl color saturation
and NieR Automata's fashion intelligence — competitive fighting game
character with Overwatch-level silhouette readability. NOT concept art.
NOT character sheet. NOT Western comic book. NOT dark or gloomy.

Single female figure, 30s. Proportions are exaggerated and committed:
shoulder width is 4 head-widths, legs are 5.5 heads long, waist is
impossibly narrow against architectural deltoids and sculpted quadriceps
that border on anatomical caricature. This is not a fit person — this
is a body designed like furniture.

DOMINANT ELEMENT occupying more visual mass than the head and shoulders
combined: an enormous rigid torus collar — a floating architectural ring
encircling neck and shoulders, WIDER than the shoulders, engraved with
repeating geometric sigils, with visible latch mechanisms like a restraint
device. The ring pulls her posture off-center to the left, implying
tension and motion. The collar reads as a self-imposed vow — ceremonial,
not decorative. This collar is the character. Everything else is subordinate.

Outfit has NieR-level fashion intelligence: a stiff, tailored jacket
with sharp lapels and visible seam structure — fabric that implies
expensive manufacturing — draped over only the right shoulder as a
deliberate styling choice. Left arm completely bare from shoulder to
fingertips; the asymmetry feels chosen, not accidental. A single-piece
bodysuit cut high on the left hip, low on the right; smooth matte
fabric with visible tension where it meets skin. Three oversized
industrial buckles along the ribs — the ONLY hardware on an otherwise
clean, tailored silhouette — sculptural and non-functional. Heeled
combat boots with angular geometry. The outfit suggests a private logic:
this character dressed with full awareness of what she communicates.

COMPOSITION: The entire left hip-to-thigh region is a SINGLE clean
shape — minimal detail, no competing elements. This breathing room is
deliberate. One continuous smooth curve runs from the top of the collar
ring, down the bare left arm, through to the fingertips — uninterrupted.
The right side has structured fabric and the jacket's weight; the left
side breathes. This asymmetry IS the composition.

PALETTE — exactly four base colors: deep saturated plum, warm porcelain,
electric teal, acid yellow. Colors should GLOW — every surface has
luminous material awareness. Fabric has sheen, skin is warm, the collar
catches light. Shading is hard-edged cel-shading with hue-shifted
shadow tones (plum shadows shift toward burgundy, teal shadows shift
toward deep ocean blue) — NOT soft gradient falloff. The overall color
feeling is LUMINOUS and CELEBRATORY — like a magical girl transformation
applied to a serious fighter. True black (#000000) appears ONLY as thin
linework. No region should feel dark, muted, or desaturated.

Dynamic 3/4 stance — weight shifted left, caught mid-pivot, kinetic
energy implied even at rest. Flat neutral background, no environment.
Graphic lighting — generous and warm, not harsh or cinematic.

AVOID: photorealism, soft rendering, painterly blending, soft gradient
shading, Western comic book style, pop art, flat posterized coloring,
thick uniform outlines, concept art sheet layout, character turnaround,
T-pose, default anime proportions, generic athletic build, muted colors,
dark backgrounds, noir lighting, gloomy atmosphere, desaturated shadows,
earth tones, grey tones, atmospheric fog, volumetric light, cinematic
color grading, multiple characters, any weapon in her hands, necklaces
or chokers that are not the described collar ring, text, logos, watermarks.

## Model-Specific Notes

### DALL·E 3

- Responds well to "NOT" statements and explicit bans
- Tends to add environmental detail; reinforce "flat neutral background" and "no environment"
- Often softens color into gradients; the "no ambient occlusion" and "no gradient shading" language helps but expect iteration
- Character proportions may need to be described even more extremely than intended to get visible exaggeration — DALL·E normalizes toward realism

### Stable Diffusion (SDXL / SD3)

- Use the avoid list as negative prompt content directly
- Stronger response to artist/aesthetic style references if applicable
- Better at maintaining flat color when explicitly prompted
- May need CFG scale adjustment to enforce unusual proportions

### Midjourney

- Responds to aesthetic collision language very well
- Tends to add cinematic atmosphere; increase emphasis on "no atmospheric fog, no volumetric lighting"
- Strong response to "--no" parameter for avoid items
- May interpret "editorial" as literally editorial photography; pair with "illustrated" or "drawn" to stay in the right register

### Flux / Modern Diffusion Models

- Generally more prompt-adherent for color constraints
- Still normalize proportions; maintain aggressive ratio language
- Better at negative space preservation than older models
- May need explicit "illustrated, not photographic" to avoid photorealistic drift

# Character Prompt Generation Card (v3.1)

You are generating text-to-image prompts for competitive fighting game characters. These are arena combatants, not magical girls, not gacha characters, not RPG party members. Follow these rules exactly.

## PROMPT STRUCTURE (this order, no exceptions)

**LINE 1 — STYLE ANCHOR (15-30 words)** Collide: Arc System Works / Guilty Gear Xrd cel-shaded rendering + high-saturation candy-bright color + haute couture fashion sensibility + Overwatch silhouette clarity. Always end with: "NOT concept art. NOT character sheet. NOT Western comic book. NOT magical girl. NOT mobile game art. NOT gacha splash art."

**SECTION 2 — BODY (2-3 sentences)** Use head-unit ratios for proportions (e.g. "legs are 5.5 heads long," "shoulders are 4 head-widths"). Never say "athletic," "muscular," "toned," "fit," or "elegant." Every body must commit to a direction: amplify mass OR amplify angularity. Use adversarial metaphor: "a body designed like furniture," "anatomy pushed to architectural caricature," "built like a weapon, not a person."

**SECTION 3 — DOMINANT ELEMENT (3-4 sentences)** One element that IS the character. Describe using body-relative scale: "WIDER than the shoulders," "larger than the torso," "longer than the character is tall." State symbolic weight: what does it mean (vow, burden, restraint, inheritance)? State hierarchy: "This is the character. Everything else is subordinate." The element must be a PHYSICAL OBJECT or GARMENT — not energy, not aura, not ribbons of light, not particle effects.

**SECTION 4 — OUTFIT (3-5 sentences)** Describe material behavior, not garment names. Wrong: "evening gown." Right: "tailored single-piece garment with visible seam structure, cut high on one hip, fabric taut against the body with no flowing excess." Convey fashion intelligence — the character chose this with intent. Identify ONE arena-excess element that breaks the sophistication. Outfits must be CONSTRUCTED (tailored, stitched, buckled, strapped) not ETHEREAL (flowing, wispy, translucent, magical). Hardware and leather over silk and chiffon.

**SECTION 5 — COMPOSITION (2-3 sentences)** Define one negative space region using anatomical landmarks: "the entire left hip-to-thigh region has NO detail." Define one unbroken arc/curve by start and end points. State the asymmetry relationship: which side is dense, which side breathes.

**SECTION 6 — COLOR (3-4 sentences)** Lock exactly 3-4 base hues by name. Colors are HIGH SATURATION and CANDY-BRIGHT — every hue at full chroma, nothing pastel, nothing washed out, nothing soft. Shading is HARD-EDGED CEL-SHADING with hue-shifted shadows (give examples: "plum shadows shift toward burgundy, not toward grey"). Two-tone or three-tone maximum per surface with CLEAN SHARP edges between tones. Surfaces have material definition (matte fabric vs. glossy leather vs. brushed metal) but NO bloom, NO glow effects, NO sparkle, NO particle effects. Black = linework only.

**SECTION 7 — POSE + LIGHTING (1-2 sentences)** Pose as a moment of fighting energy — weight shifted, fists ready, weapon gripped, stance aggressive. NOT graceful, NOT balletic, NOT serene. Flat neutral background. Hard directional lighting, clean and graphic, no atmospheric effects.

**SECTION 8 — AVOID LIST** Always include: photorealism, soft rendering, painterly blending, soft gradients, Western comic book style, pop art, flat posterized coloring, thick uniform outlines, magical girl aesthetic, transformation sequence, gacha splash art, mobile game art, RPG character art, sparkles, bloom effects, glow effects, particle effects, energy auras, flowing ethereal ribbons, translucent fabric, concept art layout, character turnaround, T-pose, default anime proportions, generic anime face, same-face syndrome, pastel colors, washed-out colors, desaturated shadows, dark backgrounds, noir lighting, gloomy atmosphere, earth tones, grey tones, atmospheric fog, volumetric lighting, cinematic color grading, multiple characters, text, logos, watermarks. Add character-specific bans for elements that would compete with the dominant element.

## HARD RULES

- Total prompt length: 200-350 words. No longer.
- Never use: "concept art," "character sheet," "anime style," "athletic," "muscular," "toned," "magical," "ethereal," "graceful," "luminous," "glow," "radiant," "flowing"
- The dominant element must be a PHYSICAL OBJECT — not light, not energy, not aura
- Every garment must include material + behavior, not just a name
- Outfits are CONSTRUCTED (leather, buckles, tailoring, hardware) not ETHEREAL (silk, ribbons, transparency)
- Shadows are hue shifts with hard cel-shaded edges, never soft gradients
- NO bloom, NO glow, NO sparkle, NO particle effects anywhere in the image
- At least one region of the character must be explicitly empty of detail
- The character must read as a FIGHTER, not a mage, not a princess, not an idol
