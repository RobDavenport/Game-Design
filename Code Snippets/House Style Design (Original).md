# House Style Design (Revised)
This visual identity fuses structural exaggeration with disciplined clarity and electric confidence. Characters are built around bold, high-impact silhouettes that read instantly at a glance. Proportions are amplified in deliberate ways — powerful shoulders, sculpted legs, dramatic collars, elongated limbs, or striking hair shapes — but always controlled by clean value separation and strong outer contours. Exaggeration is architectural, not chaotic. Each character carries one dominant visual statement that anchors their presence and makes them unforgettable.

The aesthetic embraces provocative confidence without crossing into explicit territory. Physiques are sculpted and athletic, with visible strength and deliberate form. Outfits are constructed to frame the body rather than conceal it — cropped jackets, high-cut designs, exposed midriffs, open harness elements, or layered fabrics that accentuate muscle and movement. Skin exposure is intentional and stylish, never gratuitous. Every design choice serves characterization: a blindfold implies mystery, an open back implies fearlessness, heeled boots imply defiance. The energy should feel self-assured and dominant, as if the character is fully aware of their physical presence and wields it as part of their identity.

The emotional register is electric and alive. These are characters who enjoy the fight, not endure it. Even brooding or serious archetypes carry an underlying vitality — they may be dangerous, but they are never defeated. The world these fighters inhabit is one of energy, spectacle, and presence, not melancholy or ruin.

Surface design leans into fashion authority rather than superhero uniformity. Textiles dominate over armor; tailoring, seams, straps, and material contrast add sophistication and edge. Hardware and tech elements are integrated sparingly to enhance structure, not overwhelm it. The overall tone blends high-fashion runway attitude with arena-ready combat readiness — sharp, composed, and unapologetically bold.

Color is vibrant, graphic, and celebratory — never muddy, never muted. Each character follows a disciplined palette anchored by strong dark–light contrast and one high-saturation accent that commands attention. The chroma runs hot: saturated and energetic, but controlled enough that characters feel striking rather than toy-like. Color should feel like a statement, not a mood — it announces the character before anything else does.

When executed correctly, the result is provocative yet tasteful, vivid yet disciplined: larger-than-life fighters who radiate power, confidence, and allure while feeling unmistakably alive. This is sensuality with swagger, fashion with teeth, and color that hits like a spotlight — all held within the bounds of a mature mainstream action game.
