**Boost System**  
Boost Cancel: Offensive/Pressure. Cancel any move and gain directional movement. Similar to Drive Rush, FADC, or Red/Blue Roman Cancel.  
Boost Shift: Defensive. Escape pressure with an invulnerable burst of movement in a direction. Usable during block stun. Similar to Alpha Counter, Drive Reversal, or Yellow roman cancel.

mid, low, and high.
