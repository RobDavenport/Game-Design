Supports both Retained (modern) mode via preloaded buffers and drawing of static meshes, as well as "immediate mode" for advanced users for dynamic effects.

"Gouraud PBR"

### Vertex Specification
Vertex can support the following attributes:

| Attribute       | Count | Notes                                                    |
| --------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Position        | 3     | Required.                                                |
| UV              | 2     | Required if Vertex Color not present. Both can be mixed. |
| Vertex Color    | 3     | Required if UV not present. Both can be mixed.           |
| Vertex Normal   | 3     | Required if Vertex Lighting is present.                  |
| Vertex Lighting | 3     | RGB values which refer to Metallic, Roughness, Emission  |

### Fixed Function Shaders

Fully immediate mode, fixed function graphics pipeline. 6 possible shader functions:

Position + (Color Provider) + (Lighting)
1 x 3 x 2

Color Providers
1. Position + UV
2. Position + Vertex Color
3. Position + UV + Vertex Color

Lighting Variation Shaders
1. Unlit
2. Normals + Vertex Metallic-Roughness-Emission

### Lighting

Fixed Function Lighting:
Supports 4 kinds of lights:
1. Ambient
2. Directional
3. Point
4. Spot

|                                       | Omnidirectional<br>Zero Vector Direction | Directional<br>Non Zero Vector Direction |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Global<br>(Negative Range)**        | Ambient                                  | Directional                              |
| **Local<br>(Zero or Positive Range)** | Point                                    | Spot                                     |

Negative Range can indicate global lights, and therefore position can be ignored.
Zero Direction indicates omnidirectional lights
### Console Specs

### Roms
Pure Wasm Mode
- Simplest and easiest to get started
- Requires everything to be bundled within the .wasm file itself
- Can't be compressed

Bundled Mode
- Created through dedicated bundler/exporter tool
- Allows pre-loading of assets, and customization of game files
- Can be compressed

### Game Code
Called functions:
- init
- update
- draw

### Api Functions

```rust
// Load Functions, only callable during load()
load_static_mesh(data: &[f32], pipeline: Pipeline) -> u32;
load_static_mesh_indexed(data: &[f32], indices &[u32], pipeline: Pipeline) -> u32;
load_texture(data: &[u8]) -> u32;

// Draw Functions
draw_static_mesh(index: u32)
draw_immediate_mesh(data: &[f32], pipeline: Pipeline)
draw_immediate_mesh_indexed(data: &[f32], indices: &[u32], pipeline: Pipeline)

set_texture(index: u32)
