"Gouraud PBR"

Supports both Retained (modern) mode via preloaded buffers and drawing of static meshes, as well as "immediate mode" for advanced users for dynamic effects.

Vertex can support the following attributes:

| Attribute       | Count | Notes                                                    |
| --------------- | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Position        | 3     | Required.                                                |
| UV              | 2     | Required if Vertex Color not present. Both can be mixed. |
| Vertex Color    | 3     | Required if UV not present. Both can be mixed.           |
| Vertex Normal   | 3     | Required if Vertex Lighting is present.                  |
| Vertex Lighting | 3     | RGB values which refer to Metallic, Roughness, Emission  |
Fully immediate mode, fixed function graphics pipeline. 6 possible shader functions:

1. Position + UV
2. Position + Vertex Color
3. Position + UV + Vertex Color
4. Position + UV + Vertex Normal + Vertex Lighting
5. Position + Vertex Color + Vertex Normal + Vertex Lighting
6. Position + UV + Vertex Color + Vertex Normal + Vertex Lighting

Shaders need to be pre-created for each vertex set.
